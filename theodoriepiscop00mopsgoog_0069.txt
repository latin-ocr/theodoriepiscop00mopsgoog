The life of Theodore² falls into two great divisions, the Chrono-
former extending over his first forty·two or forty-three years, and 3195? eogbre’s
mainly spent at 'Antioch (c. Α.1). 350—392-3); the latter ern-nse,
bracing the thirty-six years during which he was Bishop of Mop-
suestia (A. n. 392-3—428·9). The first division may again be
broken up into three sections, viz. (i) boyhood and youth (c. Α.1).
350—369); (ii) ascetic and student life (A. D. 369—382); (iii)

’ presbyterate (11.1). 382—392). Speaking roughly, during the first ’
of these periods he was the pupil of Libanius', during the second

of Diodore⁸, during the third of Flavian ⁴. Each was a season of Prepara-
growth3 the first in seculas knowledge, the second in spiritual {fffiksf'r Μ’

twenty (ib. 4). His ‘fall ’ and repent-
ance may have sobered his zeal, yet
there is reason to think that his Scrip-
tural studies under Diodore were con·
tinued with unabated diligence, per-
haps until the elevation os his master
to the see of Tarsus in 379.
