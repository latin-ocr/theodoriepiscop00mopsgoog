OF ‘rffls COMMENTARY. lxi

There are sundry indications that the commentaries on S. Paul’s
Epistles belong to a much later period of Theodore's literary life.
(a) Mill, in his Prolegomma (5 905, sq.), hazarded the conjecture
that the anonymous ‘F ather' to whom¹ Euthalius owed his division
of the Epistles into κεφάλαια was none other than the famous
but suspected Bishop of Mopsuestia. This theory receives some
support from the following facts now brought to light by the
recovery of the Latin Theodore. < 1) At 1 Thess· v. 1, where the
6th E‘uthalian chapter of that Epistle begins, Theodore has the
remark “alterum hic incipit capitulum.'' (2) Though 1 have not
noticed any other clear instance of this use of the word capitulum ⁸,
there is a very general coincidence between the beginnings os the
Euthalian chapters and the successive steps which Theodore seems
to take in unfolding the arguments of the several Epistles.⁸ (3)
Both the ὑποθέσεις and the headings of the κεφάλαια occasionally
accord in a striking way with Theodore's judgements or modes of
expression, e g. the hypotheses to Ephesians and Colossians both
begin ταύτην ἐπιστέλλει ‹in-d Ῥώμης, οὔπω μὲν ἑωρακώς αὐτούς,
οἰκούσας δὲ περὶ αὐτῶν ; and the third chapter of the latter Epistle
is headed περὶ τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ [κτίσεως καὶ] ἅνακτίσεως τῆς κατὰ
συνάφειαν Θεοῦ, where if we omit the bracketed words the re·

Theodore’s pen, may we not reasonably see in it his first step in
preparation for carrying out the great project of commenting upon
S. Paul⁸? Such a supposition will place the commencement of
