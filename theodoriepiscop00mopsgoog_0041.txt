seem to forbid the belief that our MSS. were copied from a
common original. On the other hand, having regard to their
general agreement, even in minute errorS, we may, Ι venture to
think, suppose that the MSS. from which C and H were derived -
had themselves been transcribed from the same copy. If the
Harley and Corbie MSS. are not sister documentS, they may cer-
tainly be related to each other as first cousinS.

(4) There can be· little doubt that the Harley MS„ though (4) The

has been less carefully executed than the latter. (a) It abounds in less eareful
omissions of minor wordS, many of which are necessary to the ζζῗῒῗζζῗς
sense. Ι have noticed over twenty-five such omissions in H, the two.
whilst C presents only six. Consecutive words or whole lines are
occasionally dropt per homoeoteleuton (e. g. on pp. 40, 52, 56, 61,

68, 100, 103, 298), a fault stom which C is almost wholly free.
(b) H exhibits far more than C of such marks of carelessness as
the iteration of wordS, and copyists' blunderS, e. g. the writing of
praedatum for praedisamm, ita for ira, confersam for confessam,
sactdtate for facilitate, apostolus for apostoltkus, produndt'tatem for
profunditatem, praestitus for praestitutus, reformata tamen sor
re, forma tamen, venerabis et dtkerabt'lt's for uenerabilis· et desidera·
mic, cvgnittonem for oognationem, reducti for seducti, manifesta for
mantffada, demea‘eratis for demettebatis. In the Corbie MS. such
