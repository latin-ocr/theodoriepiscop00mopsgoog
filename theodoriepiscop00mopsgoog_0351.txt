IN EPISTOLAM B. PAULI

AD COLOSSENSES.

ARGUMENTUM.

SCRIBIT Colossensibus beatus Paulus sicut scripsit Ephesiis
quos antequam scriberet non uiderat. ostendit autem hoc ipse

in suis scriptiS‚ quando quidem dicens: audientes fidem uestram in
Christo et caritatem quam habetis in omnes sanctos ,· quando uero

scribit: uolo autem uos scire, quale certamen habeam pro uobis et 5
Itis qui in Laodicia sunt et quotquot non uiderunt faciem meam in

 

carne. est autem argumentum epistolae tale. consuetudo illi

ι. Scribit Colossensibus, &cl ‘Argu
ment. The Colossians. like the Ephe·
sians (supra, p. 112, 1. α, note), were
personally unknown to S. Paul at the
time when he wrote his Epistle. Ac-
cording to his custom in such caseS,
the Apostle begins by magnifying the
Person and Work os C hrist3 a course to
which in the present instance he was
further impelled by the necessity of
counteracting the salse teacbing os the
legalists‚ against whom he proceeds to
warn the Colossian Church in express
terms. The Epistle ends with exhorta·
tions to the fulfilment of sundry Christian
duties'

p.282‚u. 7, 18‚note. Thdt., who had rightly
rejected Th.'s view as to S. Paul's want
of persona] acquaintance with the Ephe·
sians (p. 112, l. 2, note), again declines
to follow him here, where Th. is on
safer ground; and meets the argument
derived from c. ii. 1 by regarding ὅσοι
as exclusive: τινὲς μέντοι φασὶν μηδέπω
τοὺς Κολοσσαεΐς τεθεαμένον τὸν θ. ἁπό-
στολον γράψαι πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὴν ἐπιστολήν,
καὶ τοῦτο συνιστάνειν ἐκ τῶν ῥητῶν ἐκείνων
ἐπιχειροῦσιν [citing ii. 1]. ἔδει δὲ συνι·
δεῖν τῶν ῥητῶν τὴν διάνοιαν· βούλεται γὰρ
εἰπεῖν ὅτι ὀὐ μόνον ὑμῶν, ἀλλὰ καὶ
τῶν μὴ τεθεαμένων με πολλὴν ἔχω φρον-
τίδα. Chrys, Oec. and Thpht. concur
with Th.
