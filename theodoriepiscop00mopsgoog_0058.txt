which had ’ arisen amongst the clergy of that country. The
Spaniards, however, resented the interference of a foreigner ;
whereupon the Bishop wrote his Concordantia to shew that the
Irish people were originally of Spanish extraction. “ He enjoyed
his bishoprick but a short time (the writer adds), when the invasion
of the Moors 'drove him back to Rome and destroyed his epis-
copal see. But the Pope provided him with a titular bishoprick
in England, by virtue of which he assisted at the Council before-
mentioned '' [viz. the Roman Council of 721]. Ι have no means
of investigating the truth of this story, but it rests upon the state-
me'nt of a credible writer, who asserts that he received it from
a friend who had had access to the MS! The circumstances
are not improbable, sor the invasion of the Moors in 710 was
immediately preceded by a serious quarrel between the Spanish
Church and Rome, caused by the action of the King Witiza
(Baronius s. ann. 701). If the account is trustworthy‚ it may
have been in Spain that Sedulius had the opportunity os seeing
the Latin Theodorej, in which case it will follow that the trans·
lation was extant in that country under the name os Ambrose
at the beginning of the eighth century.

(d) The next collector who uses the Latin Theodore is
Rabanus MauruS, Abbat of Fulda from 825 to 847, and from the
latter year to his death in 856, Archbishop of Mainz. His
Enarrationes on S. Paul belong to the last days of his lise at
F ulda and are said to have been finished about the year 842 ⁹.
The interesting letters which form a preface to his commentaries
establish two facts³3 first, that the excerpts were made by Rabanus
and his assistants directly from the works of the several authors
who are quoted, secondly, that with the exception of Origen he
,believed all the contributors to have been orthodox. It seems
