power and theological learning, the third in pastoral experience.
Few of the great teachers of the ancient Church enjoyed a longer
or more varied preparation for the duties of the episcopate or
for the work of an expositor.
Hisltterary Theodore’s literary activity began at an early age, possibly
acuvnty. while he was yet a student under Diodore, and continued till at
least the end of the second decade of the fifth century¹. The
fecundity of his pen became proverbial amongst both his friends
and his enemies’. In modern times the bibliography of his works
has formed the subject of several careful treatises to which I must
be content to refer the reader⁸. For our present purpose it is
enough to examine the relation of time which these commen-
taries bear to his other exegetical writings ⁴.
Date os his Theodore’s first book was exegetical—a commentary on the
1ξὲξὲοῶ Psalter. Leontius mentions with a sneer the report that Theodore
ry. began to expound Scripture at the age of eighteen‘· (c. A. D. 368) 3
the Chronicler of Edessa, with an extreme rebound froin this
exaggeration, places the beginning as late as A. n. 405 ⁶. The
latter date may be that of one of his more mature workS, possibly
os the ἑρμηνεία τῆς κτίσεως. The exposition of the Psalms was
certainly written before its author's elevation to the episcopate,

perhaps before his ordination to the priesthood⁷.
