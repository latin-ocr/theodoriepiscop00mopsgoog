2 Tim. iii. 1-——43 iv. 2. (d) Theodore is also singularly suc-
cessful in directing attention to the force of subordinate words
and clauses. It is a principle with him that in S. Paul's writings
not a clause or a word is without its force or bearing on the
argument—nothing is added ἅπλῶς (absolute) 3 and the endeavour
to carry out this principle leads him to suggest references which are
at once original and interesting, if not always probable. Com-
pare his remarks on πνεύματος, Gal. vi. 183 πάσης, 1 Thess. iv. 3 3
σημεῖον, 2 Thess. iii. 173 ἔργον, 1 Tim. iii. 13 σπένδομαι, 2 Tim.
iv. 6. (e) His admiration sor the Apostle is genuine, and rises
at times to an enthusiasm which expresses itself in the warmest
terms (Gal. iii. ²9 3 iv. 21 3 r Tim. i. 3 3 see especially Philemon,
9) 3 but it does not prevent him from recognizing the rugged
brevity of S. Paul's style, and the obscurity which sometimes
results from the struggling os so many great thoughts for simul-

taneous utterance (Rom. ix. 22, sq. 3 Gal. v. 4, 123 Eph. iii. 4 3 -

1 Tim. i. 3-—43 iv. 3). He makes it a part os his business as
an expositor to point out what he considers to be the Apostle's
characteristics (ἰδιώματα, proprietates), the frequent parenthesis,
the ecbatic ἵνα, the vehement μή γένοιτο, the occasional com-
mingling of incompatible metaphorS, the broken elliptical form
of many os the sentences (Rom. ix. 22 3 Gal. ii. 4, 9, 173 iii.
13—143 Eph. vi. 11-123 1 Tim. i. 3—4).

It is however in his logical rather than in his grammati-

His en·

cal and lexical treatment of the Epistles that T heodore's deavour to

power chiefly shews itsels. His interest in the language is pro-
fessedly subordinate to his interest in the thought which it en-
shrines (Eph. ii. 12). He is never weary of pointing out to the
reader the undercurrent of close reasoning which pervades
S. Paul's letterS. This is done by various methodS. (a) A care·

fully constructed argument is prefixed to each Epistle. By sar ·

the most striking as well as the longest arguments are those
which occur at the opening of the Epistles to the Ephesians and
to Philemon; but not one of the Epistles represented in the
Latin translation is without such an introduction. These argu-
ments not only deal with the occasion and purpose of the EpistleS,
but sketch out their plan. More than once good service is done
by them in the way os comparing Epistles of kindred subjects
or character, and noticing the points of contact and os dissilience
