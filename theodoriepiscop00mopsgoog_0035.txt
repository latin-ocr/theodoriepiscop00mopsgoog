THE mss, oN wmcn “rins EDITION 1s BASED. xxvii .

The MS. belonged to the Hospital of Saint N icholas near
Cusa, on the Mosel, founded by Cardinal N icholas of Cusa,
who died in 1464¹. Several other volumes in the Harleian
Library came from the same place.”

To this full and lucid statement of the palaeographical features
of the Harley MS„ it is only necessary to add some particulars as
to its contents. The eight quires ,missing stom the beginning
appear to have been occupied by the commentas-y of Ambrosiaster
on Romam, 1 Corinthians and 2 Cor. i. 1——173 for the first page
of the existing volume begins with the words “ [appa]ratibus
uincitur quod apostolus semper spreuit,'' &e—part of Ambrosi-
aster’s exposition of that verse ⁸ 3 and this commentary proceeds
without break as far as the prologue to the Galatians, where the
Latin Theodore takes its place. It is worthy of note that the
second hand of which Mr Thompson speaks replaces the first
precisely where the Theodorean matter begins, and without the
slightest interruptim, the first two words of the prologue to
Galatians (“ Beatus apostolus ²²) completing the line in which the
commentary of Ambrosiaster on 2 Cor. had come to an end.
The following is the order in which the Theodore is distributed:
Galatians (i), ff. 38 b-—60 b ε (ἰί), 60 b--7 5 b; Ephesiam, 75 b—
97 b; PhilippianS, 97 b—111 b3 Colossians‚ 111 b-—126 a;
1 Thessalonians, 126 a—136 a; 2 Thessalonians, 136 a—141b3
1 Timothy, 141 b—171 a; 2 Timothy, 171 a-—181 a3 Titus, 181 a
-187 a; Philemon, 187 a—-192 a. Fr: 192 a (in part) and 192 b
are blank. As in C, the text of the Epistles is divided into
capitula, which accord generally with the system adopted in the
best MSS. of the Vulgate 3 in two of the three instances where
the capitula in C begin differently from those of the Vulgate,
H holds with C against the ordinary division.
