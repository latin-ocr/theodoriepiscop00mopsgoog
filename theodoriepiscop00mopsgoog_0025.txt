Theodore is next in the frequency of the. extr-acts which bear his
-name3 but his commentaries have been used with cantion, e.g.,
of his interesting but questionable remarks on Philipp. ii. 5--1 1,
scarcely anything has been preserved, whilst the exposition of
ColosS. i„ 15, sq. is quoted in part, but, with an eager disclairner

‚ on the part of the catenist of any sympathy· with his views

Out of, about 130, excerpts from Theodore 1 have noticed only
some 30 which are assigned to him by the catenist with the
introductory formula Θεόδωρος δέ φησιν or the like3 of these 21
are in the catena on the Epistle to the Ephesia-ns. In the great
majority. of. instances the name is added in the margin in the
same hand as that in which, the catena itself is‘ written3 whilst in
the body of the catena the paragraph is introduced with the
words ἄλλος [δὲ] φησίν, οι· is left without introduction of· any kind.
The phrase ἄλλος. resa„ occurs in 54 instances3 the wholly unr
appropriated extracts are fevv, most of those which seem to be
such being in fact mere continuations of comments previously
assigned. Very occasionally the marginal ascription proves to be
in error, and a passage marked as Theodore’s appears to be no
part of his work¹, or a Theodorean· fragment is assigned to another
writer’3 more frequently, a Theodorean excerpt is attached to
a comment of Chrysostom⁸, or Chrysostom succeeds to Theodore
without due notice of the change. But on the whole the identi-
fication in the margin of this MS„ so far as our author is con-
cerned‚ is singularly accurate and trustworthy.

² Cramer vi. 55. 6—12 is wrongly
assigned to Chrysostom.

³ Ε. g. Cramer vi. 346. 25—31 is
under Ἰωάννου Χρυσοστόμου. The re·
verse os this is less uncommon. The
omission of Th.'s name is sometimes
due to Cramer's transcribet, e.g. Cra-
mer vi. 52. ¹²3 93. 213 2²5· rom-here

he has represented Oeoh⁰s ΦΗ. as

as follows: ὂχ. θεοβ, θὲόχ, θΕόΔὝ,
and once [f. 196 b=Cr. vii. 221,

egio—i. e. θεόδωρος Mothonem-lar. The

last contraction is not uncommon in

the margin of the comm. on the Ep.

to the chrews‚ where we also find 2

i.e. θεοδώρου Ἀντιοχέως. For Theodo-
ret, where he is cited by name, as in
the last-named Ep„ the abbreviation

is ΘΕΟΔωΕΞ.
