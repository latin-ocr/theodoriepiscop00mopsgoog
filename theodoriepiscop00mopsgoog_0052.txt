xlii INTEGRITY, PECUL1AR1T1ES‚ AND HISTORY

Gal. iii. 3, insensati (ἀνόητοι), inchoantes (ἐναρξάμενοι, cf. Phil. ἰ. 6);
8, ante euangelizauit (προευηγγελίσατο, cf. ante confirmatum, iv. 1 7);
Eph. iv. 3, adcelerantes (σπουδάζοντες) 3 29, necessitatis (τῆς >metas->3
v. 3 1, adiungetur (προσκολληθήσεται); Phil. i. 7, oempartictpes
gratiae (συγκοινωνοῦς. ..τῆς χάριτος) 3 ii. 14, disceptationibus (διαλο-
γισμῶν), 19, aequanimem (ἰσόψυχον) ; iii. 16, occurrimus (ἑφθά-
σαμεν); iv. 3, coniugalis (σύνζυγε), simul mecum decertauerunt
(συνήθλησάν μοι), 15, exii (ἔξῆλθον); Col. iii. 16, ditissime (πλου-
σίως, cf. p. xl). Occasionally, a word of Greek origin is either
preferred to the usual Latin equivalent, or placed side by side
with it ; e. g. apon'or (Gal. iv. 20), arra (Eph. i. 14), schema
(Phil. ii. 7), agon (Col. i. 293 ii. 1), mysterium (passim) 3 but on
the {vhole our translator is careful not to overload his pages with
HellenismS, and uses Latin words where he can find or form any
sufficiently close to the Greek. To his fidelity to the Greek text
we may also refer at least in part the steady use of certain equiva-
lentS, such as bonum placitum for εὔδοκία, caritas for ἀγάπη, cognitio
for ἐπίγνωσις, cooperarius for συνεργός, gloria for δόξα, inhabitare
for κατοιιὲεῖν, inoperari for ἐνεργεῖσθαι, minorari for ὑστερεῖσθαι,
nocere aliquem for α’δικεῖν τινα, sacnficium for θυσία. [ii] He
adheres as far as possible to the grammar os the Greek text,
as for instance in the use of the infinitive (Gal. i. 16, nudare,-
Eph. i. 4, esse ,· iv. 28, retribuere ,· Col. i. 25, adimplere ,· iv. 3,
loqui ,· 6, πῖνε), of the active participle (Gal. ii. 1, adsumens ‚-
9, cognoscentes ,· iii. 3, inchoantes 3 Eph. i. 12, audientes ,· Phil. ii.
28, uidentes,· iv. 18, suscipiens) 5 of constructions alien or even
abhorrent to the Latin idiom (Gal. v, 17, ueritati non suaderi ,-
Phil. i. 28, non...in nullo,· iii. 4, et quidem qo liabens ,· Col. ii. 16,
quae [ἅτινα] est 3 iv. 13, pro...eorum). To the same cause we
may attribute his repeated employment of the clumsy periphrasis
introduced by is qui, ille qui, in cases where the Latin Vulgate
is content with the simple relative (Gal. iv. 22, ille quidem qui...
ille uero qui [ὁ μὲν...ὁ δέ]; ν. 24, ille autem qui,· Eph. i. 15, illam
quae est secundum uos [τήν καθ’ ὑμᾶς] ; Phil. i. 1 1, fructum illum...
qui per, &a [καρπὸν τᾶν διά, κ.τ.λ.]; 27, illa quae de uobis sunt
[τὰ περὶ ὖμῶν] 3 iii. 13, &c.).

(c) Our translator’s independence of the Latin versions is
still more clearly shewn in the large number of renderings for

evenwhere which there is apparently no Latin authority, yet which do not

the Greek
does not

seem to be attributable to any of the above-mentioned causes 3

require a eg. gente'h‘s (Gal. iii. 28), desponsatoribus (iv. 2), obduci (v. 1), appeti-
