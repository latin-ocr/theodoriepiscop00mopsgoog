munale of the neighbouring city of Amiens¹. The second volume
contains the commentar-y on the Epistles from Galatians to
Philemon inclusive. It consists of 182 leaves of vellum, measuring
15 κ ιο incheS, gathered into 24 quires· Each quire, except the
last, has its proper signature in Roman numerals at the foot of
the last page3 each contains 8 leaves, with the exception of the
5th, 19th and 24th, which have five, five and four leaves respect—
ively. The Epistles with their commentary are thus distributed:
Galatians (i), ff 1—28 a: (ii), 28 a—46 b3 Ephesians, 46 b—-
68b3 Philippians 3 68 b—85 a ; Colossians, 85 a—-102 a3 1 Thes-
salonianS, 102 a—115 a, 2 Thessalonians, 115 b—121 b;
1 Timothy, 121 b—155 b3 2 Timothy, 155 b—167b3 Titus,
167 b—-176 b; Philemon, 176 b—182 a. The last page and a
half are blank.

The Carlovingian minuscule is the character employed. The
text is written in semi-uncinis, and for the most part in red or
green ⁸. The initial letters are occasionally foliated, or formed
after some grotesque device3 but no other ornamentation occurS.

In M. Garnier's excellent catalogue this MS. is ascribed to
the oth century, in conformity with the view expressed in a recent
hand on the first page⁸. It may be questioned, however, whether
the MS. exhibits clear indications of a date earlier than the roth
century. The accompanying faesimile‚ from a photograph taken
by M. Garnier's kind permission and under his superintendence,
will assist the reader in forming his own judgement uponthe
point.

The text of the Epistles is divided into capitula according to
a system which generally coincides with that adopted in the
Codices Amiatinus and FuldensiS, i. e. Galatians, 373 EphesianS,
