may not our translation in this manner have found its way
into Italy, and from Italy into Westem Europe?

(c) ΤΙιε first Westem writer who quotes the translation is
probably the Irish scholar known as Sedulius Scotus Junior. In
his Collectanea on S. Paul Sedulius cites ‘ Ambrose ' twice, on
Rom. vi. 6, and on Gal. iv. 2 5¹3 the extract being in the former
instance ftom Ambrosiaster ⁹, in the latter from Theodore⁸. It
is not easy to fix the age of this Sedulius, That he was not
the fifth century poet of that name is now acknowledged on
all hands. Archbishop Ussher had already noticed⁴ that the
decrees of the Roman Council of 721 were signed by a Sedulius
who describes himself as “episcopus Britanniae de genere Scoto-
rum⁸.’' More recent opinion, however, has identified the com-
mentator with a third Sedulius who is stated by Hepidanus
(† A.D. 1080) to have fiourished about the year 818⁶. Montsaucon
in his palaeographia graeca describes a MS. Graeco-Latin Psalter,
undoubtedly as he thinks of the ninth century⁷, which bears the

that the Greek writing is of a distinctly Westem type⁸, and that
the author of the commentary displays a knowledge of Greek
which would have qualified him to write such a Ms.⁹. Again, the
