THEODORUS MOPSUESTENUS
IN EPISTOLAM B. PAULI

AD EPHESIOS.

ARGUMENTUM&

SCRIBIT Ephesiis hanc epistolam beatus PauluS‚ eo modo
quo et Romanis dudum scripserat quos necdum ante uiderat.
et hoc euidenter ipse ostendit, in ipsa epistola sic scribens:
propter hoc et ego audiens eam fidem quae in uobis est in domino
5 Iesu, et caritatem quam in omnes sanctos habetis, non cesso gratias

agere pro uobis.

numquam profecto dixisset se auditu de illis

ῐ. Scribit Ephesia, δια] In the argument
Th. (ι) compares the present Ep. with the
Ep. to the Romam, (2) discusses the
date of this Ep. and its relation to the
Ephesian ministry of the Apostle John,
(3) points out that the difficulty of the
Ep. lies partly in the words, which he
promises to explain in detail. Under the
first head he shews that the Epp. to the
Romans and Ephesians agree in that (α)
both were addressed to Churches not as
yet visited by S. Paul, (b) both have for
their main subject the benefits derived
srom the Incarnation, (c) both consist of
two divisions‚ a doctrinal and an ethical,
the latter part in each Ep. opening with
the same form of exhortation (παρακαλῶ
οὖν ύμᾶςε Rom. xii. 1, Eph. iv. 1). On the
other hand the Ep. to the Ephesians dif-
sers from the Ep. to the Romans in its
tone and scope, handling the doctrine of
Redemption in an uncontroversial and
devotional manner.

α. quos necdum ante uiderat] So Seve-
rianuS, according to Cramer's catena:

Σευηριανὸς δέ φησιν· ὥσπερ τοῖς Ῥωμαίοις
ἔγραφεν ὅτε μηδέπω αὐτοὺς τεθέατο, οὕτως
καὶ τοῗςἙφεσίοις. Similarly the Euthalian
argument (ἀμφοτέροις δὲ έξ ἀκοῆς γνώριμος)
and Oec. (ταύτην ἐπιστέλλει...οὕπω μὲν
ἑωρακὼς αὐτούς, ἀκούσας δὲ περὶ αὐτῶν).
On the other hand the argument of Thdt.
winds up a careful summary of the facts
with a distinct rejection of Th.'s view; cs.
Thdt.’s comm.''on c. 1. 15 (διὰ τοῦτο κάγὼ

ἀκούσας, κ.τ.λ.); ἐντεῦθέν τινες {merbru-
σαν ὡς μηδέπω θεασάμενος αὐτοὺς δ θεῖος

ἀπόστολος γέγραφεν τὴν ἐπιστολήν· ἔδει δὲ
συνιδεῖν δτι καὶ Κορινθίους ἐπιστέλλων τὰ
λυπηρὰ οἰκούσας ἀπέστειλεν [citing 1 Cor.
i. 1 1].

4. propter hoc, ἕνα] C. i. 15, 16. A
comparison of this rendering with that of
the same verses where they occur in the
course os the comm„ and os both with the
O. L. and Vulg., is instructive as shewing
to what extent our translator held himself
sree to translate at will, and how far he
was influenced by existing versions.
