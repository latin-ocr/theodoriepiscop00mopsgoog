its origin. Lastly, in the second half of the sixth century the
Church of North Africa is known to have been passing through a
crisis most favourable to the productiora of such a work. Many of
her clergy‚ a few perhaps of her educated laity‚ were suffering
persecution imprisonment or exile in behalf of Ibas, Theodoret,
and Theodore. What wonder if the far-famed Commentator was

studied by the sufferers, or if an attempt was made to justisy their
attitude by the translation of one os his most important works into

the vulgar tongue ? The translator may have learnt to sympa-
thize with the teaching as well as with the ecclesiastical troubles of
his author3 and in this case after the fashion of the times he
would naturally have endeavoured to gain a hearing for him
among Latin-speaking Churchmen by placing his work under the
sanction of a great Western name.

If the above conclusions are sound, the work of translation was
probably accomplished in the interval between the publication of
Justinian’s edict and the Emperor's death (ΑΛ). 544—56 5). That -
the name of the translator will ever be discovered is perhaps
unlikely. There-are objections to the claims of FacunduS, Juni-
lius, and Primasius of Adrumetum3 and of the other African
opponents of the edict we know too little to form an opinion.
The unequal execution of the work, alternating between a sair
imitation of the style of contemporary writers and a slipshod laxity
suggestive of haste or inexperience‚ leads to the supposition that
we have before us the first and perhaps the only literary effort
os a person used merely to the language of the Church or
of the law courtS, a Bishop, or it may have been a jurist, who
had recourse to the assistance of the pen when his mouth was
stopped by the severity of the Emperor¹. That his work has
survived is due to the protection of S. Ambrose’s name, which

has covered at once the faults os the Latinity and the theological
eccentricities of the original.

¹ In my study of the translation it might account sor the extreme in-
has more than once occurred to me equality of his work, without leaving
that the writer may have been a ,per- unexplained his African Latinity and
son os Greek descent, who had passed evident familiarity with the Latin ver·
the greater part of his life in N. Africa. sions os S. Paul’s Epistles.
