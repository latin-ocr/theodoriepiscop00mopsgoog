been made by the help of the Latin version. In a few instances

have in every case been distinguished from the MS. text by the

nse of aquare brackets.

>2. The Latin text, as I have already intimated, rests upon l{iasa}

the evidence of two MSS. in which it is preserved entire, supple-
mented by that of several printed compilations and of one still in
MS„ which contain portions of the version more or less extensive.

(i). Codex A mbianenstlc, olim Corbeiensis (C).

This Ms, Cardinal Pitra's sole authority, 'forms the second of
the two magnificent volumes described by the Benedictine editors

Both volumes formerly belonged to the Abbey

of S. Peter'S, Corbie, where they remained until the end of the last
century⁹. They are now deposited in the Bibliotheque Com-

following indications of the presence
of these MSS. in the Corbie collection.
(1) They are represented in the list
which was furnished to Montfaucon
by the then Prior of Corbie (bibl.
biblioth. 11. p. 1406: ’Ἥ ἰν. D. Com-
mentarii in epist. Pauli S. Ambrosio
attributi, Vol. 1. cod. membr. saec. .

saeculi 9’'). (τ) An ancient catalogue
(MS. Vat. 520), belonging to the early
part of the 13th⁴ century, (Mai, Spic.
Rom. V. 206) contains the entry:
“61. Ambrosius super ep. ad Rom.

that he was wrong, and asserted the
identity os these MSS. with the Ami-
ens MSS. 87 and 88. A slightly
earlier catalogue, now in the collection
οἱ Sir T. Phillipps, enumerates “Amb.
exp. in ep. ad Galathas'’ [MS. 43]-

and “exp. eiusdem in epp. Pauli. et ·

item ad Thess. expositio’'; but the
description is ambiguous Τὴε other
fragment which Mai prims, perhaps
the earliest of the three Corbie lists,
makes no mention of Ambrose on S.
Paul. From these facts we may gather
that C was already in possession os the
Abbey of S. Peter’s Corbie, about the
year 12003 further than this our pre·
sent knowledge does not enable us to
go. with regard to the sources from
which the Corbie MSS. were derived,
Delisle has pointed out (p. 111, sq.)
that (a) a succession of scribes flourish·
ed at Corbie from cent. viii. to cent.
xiii.; (b) many of the MSS. were
brought to Corbie from Italy (especi-
ally from Monte Cassino), and some
from its German namesake, whilst
Ireland supplied a sew; (c) purchases
were sometimes made by the Abbey
from other librar-ies in France. A
letter os Pope Alexander 111 (fl. A. D.
1166—1179) records a resolution on
the part os the monks of Corbie to
repair their books and to add by
purchase to the number. It would
seem then that our MS. might have
been either (ι) written at Corbie
in the 9th or roth century3 or (π)
imported from Gennany at some period
between ΑΛ), 900 and {2003 or (3)
procured from some other F rench
house towards the end of this interval.
