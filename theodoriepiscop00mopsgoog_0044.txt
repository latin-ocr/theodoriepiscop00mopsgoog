Robert of Bridlington are for critioel purposes of little value.
There are signs that Lanfranc’s MS„ like that which Rabanus
used, was closely related to C and H, approaching perhaps
nearest to the former. But both these compilers abbreviate their
author, reconstruct his sentences, and alter his language with so
much freedom that it is osten impossible to say what text they
may have had before them. Omissions -of words necessary to
the sense are frequent, difficulties are evaded by the arbitrary
substitution of something more or less appropriate to the matter
in hand3 and thus the evidence sails us just where it is most
needed. Here and there, however, Lanfranc has either retained
or conjectured the true reading ; e. g. p. 33 praedicatum, where
both our MSS. have fallen into the prodigious blunder of repeat-
ing praeuaricatum from the previous line; p. 261 imagt’mk, where
in magmis· has passed muster in Rabanus as well as in C and H.
With regard to our translator's version of S. Paul’s Epistles¹, its
peculiarities are altogether overlooked by Lanfranc and Robert,

without any apparent rule to guide his choice. Thus, to take the
first of the Epistles upon which he quotes our author, rather more
than half of the Epistle to the Philippians is given as it stands in
the translated Theodore, the following being the passages which
are presented in this form: Phil. i. 1-—3o; ii. 1, 2, 7-12, 14,
28-303 iii. 1—-4‚ 6—123 iv. 13, 23. In the remaining verseS,
though for the most part they immediately precede extracts from
Theodore, or are even embedded in them, the Vulgate is adopted.
It would seem as if the compilet had begun by simply transcribing
the MS. before him, but upon becoming aware of its serious
divergence from the Vulgate, he had provided himself with a copy
of the latter, and had endeavoured though with only partial
success to substitute the authorized version of the Epistles for that
which he found in his MS.
