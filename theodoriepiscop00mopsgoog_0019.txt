1854¹3 and the work was shewn to be· a translation of a Greek
commentary, of which the original was due to the exegetical' sch-001²
of Antioch and to its· greatest expositor, Theodore. Dr Jacobi's
essay was followed in 1859 by an article in the Cambridge soumal
of Classtkal and Sacred Philology'‚ in which the same conclusion
was quite independently reached by the Rev. F. J. A. Hort.
Mr (now Professor) Hort was guided to the Theodorean author-
ship of the new commentar-y partly by the nature of its contents‚
partly by the character of the text of S. PauPs Epistles which
it exhibited ⁸. Both in Prof. Jacobi's and in ΜΓ Hort’s essays
the identification was clenched and placed beyond reasonable
doubt by a reference, in Mr Hort's article worked out with some*
minuteness of detail ξ t'o the Greek fragments of Theodore’s
eommentary already printed· in Dr Cramer's· Catenae Graecorum
Patr-um.

Within the last few years ,the interest excited by this dis-
covery has been revived through the· detection by Dr Hort of
another copy of the same commentavy among the MSS. of the
Harley collection at the British Museum⁶. This second MS.
seems to be somewhat earlier than the first 3 and though less
carefully written and perhaps less trustworthy as a whole, it is a
valuable witness in many places where the Corbie MS. is corrupt
or doubtful, and it has occasionally supplied words or even lines
which were wanting in the latter. A third MS. is now known
to exist in one of the private libraries of Europe ⁶3 but its
