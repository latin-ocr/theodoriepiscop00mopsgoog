OF THE ιΑτῐΝ TRANSLATION. lv

least not improbable that he was the means of transmitting to
Africa the commentary on Galatians and the nine following
Epistles. Once brought to Africa the book would not have
wanted a translator. The names of the Carthaginian deacon
Liberatus, and of the Bishops Primasius and Victor will readily
occur 3 but it is uncertain whether any of these possessed a
sufficient knowledge of Greek ¹. Junilius', although possibly a lay-
man and a jurist, may have been willing, as he certainly was able,
to render this service to his party3 and there are some a priori
reasons for crediting him with the translation. Or the work may
have been due to some more obscure hand, the pastitne of a
weary exile or incarceration endured on behalf of the Church's
independence and the sanctity of the dead. A perusal of Victor’s
Chrom‘con' will shew that at this period there were not a few
African Churchmen qualified by their knowledge, zeal, and en-

forced leisure for the performance of this task. (d) The resem- (d) Adop-
