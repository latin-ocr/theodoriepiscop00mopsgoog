are merely the ordinary forms of post-Augustan Latinity. But
(a) a large proportion are, without doubt, characteristic of the
African dialect; and in my notes to the translation Ι have had
frequent occasion to call attention to points of contact between
our translator-'s diction and that of such writers as ApuleiuS,
Tertullian‚ and Cyprian. (b) Noteworthy also is the circum-
stance that in his choice of words he continually treads in
the steps of the law-books and juristS. The coincidences are so
marked that one might readily suspect him of having been at
some time in his life engaged in the practice of the law, or of
having at least received a legal education. (c) Lastly, there are
certain words and forms in the use of which our translator seems
to stand alone, and some of these he repeats with a remarkable
pertinacity. WordS, too, which in other writers are of the rarest‚
are amongst his commonest. These and other singularities of
style ought certainly to assist us in identifying the author of the
translation, should any other work of his survive and bear its
writer's name.

translation is to some extent an independent rendering of the ὲῗὲἓῗςῖξζ
