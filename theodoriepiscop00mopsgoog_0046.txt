XXXVI INTEGRITY, PECULIARITIES, AND HISTORY

sair field for enquiry (e. g. the comment on 1 Tim. iii. 8), we may
suppose that the translator aimed at giving a complete version,
corresponding line by line with. his original, and faithfully reflect-
ing its sense¹. How far, it may be asked, has he succeeded in
this intention ? ' ’
Justaqeae In not a few instances he has without doubt misunderstood or
'¹¹¹ which inadequately expressed the meaning os the Greek (Gal. i. 3—53

ii'affnslator ἰν. 253 Eph. i. 8—10; Phil. i. 1, 2 [σὺν ἐπισκόποις, ίοφὶπνρἰ],

Phil. ii. 15) ς οι· offered a paraphrase rather than translation (as of
ποῦ ποτε στήσεται αὑτῷ ; Gal. iv. 19 ; ὁμοίως ἐμοί, Phil. iii. 17 ς

iii. 2); or changed the construction (Gal. iv. 243 v. 83 pr. i.
13,.14; ii. 22, &c.); or manifested carelessness in the choice os
conjunctionS, using nam for δέ (Eph. iii. 19), and autem for γάρ·
(1 Tim. iii. 2, bis). Again, a remarkable disregard for the amenities

of composition is shewn in his rendering of certain unimportant
passageS, such as Theodore’s brief comments upon the saluta·
tions at the end of the several Epistles3 whilst in abstruse dog-
matic passages (e. g. Phil. ii. 6 sq.; Col. i. 13 sq.), though he
labours to do his best, his powers are unequal to the task of

general quent use osan alternative or a double rendering (e. g. διάστημα,
