from Theodore’s commentaries on S. Paul, 1 found in Coislin 26⁸
(Montfaucon, p. 82) a considerable number of passages substanti·
ally identical with the Theodorean fragments preserved in Coislin
204. None, however, appeared under the two Epistles which I was
able to test (Galatians and Colossians) which were not to be
found in 204, whilst scarcely a third of the fragments yielded by ,
204 occurred also in‘ 26. Moreover a comparison of the extracts
common to both MSS. with each other and with the Latin led to
the suspicion that the compilet of 26 had derived his Theodorean
passages from the catena represented by 204⁸. The former MS.
diverges from the Latin where the latter agrees with it, the varia-
tions being often obviously due to an abridgement or recasting of
the sentences in which they occur. Even the hostile remarks of
Cramer's catenist upon Theodore's comment on Col. i. 15, are
reechoed in Coislin 26⁴, with just enough of difference to mark
the desire of the second-hand compilet to assume the position of
an independent critic. To collect and print the variants afforded
by a witness of this kind, appeared worse than useless

was necessarily very cursory‚ but suf-
ficiem to discourage the expectation

breviations Os, ΘὲΟχΙ, ΘΕΟΔΙῘ, ΘΕΟΔὛ,
appeared in every case, excepting the
comment on 2 Tim. iv. 13, to denote
Theodoret. ,

mentary on the Acts and Catholic
Epistles, and on the remaining Epistles
of 5. l'aul. The text is embedded in
the comm., but for the most part
written in red ink3 both text and

page. The comm. is much brieser
than in Cramer's catena, whilst the
text is given in larger portions. Mont-
faucon assigns to Coislin 26 a slightly
higher date than to 204—“decimi
circiter vel undecimi ineuntis sae·
culi''; but that the catena itself is of
inferior antiquity there can be little
doubt. His further remark——“mag-
narn habet cum Oecumenio affim-
tatem. cuius expositiones fere sem r
mutuatur-”——is certainly not justi ed
by a comparison of the commentary
on Colossinus (which was transcribed
for me by M. Graux of Paris) with the
Oecumenian eatena on that Epistle.

³ Compare e.g. Coislin 204 f. 29a
[ins. pp. 57. ll. 25—30; 58, ll. 16, 17]
with the corresponding quotation in
Coisl. 26, f. 238a: οὐ γὰρ ἐν ἀθανάτῳ
φύσει διακριθήσεται περιτετμημένος ἢ
ἀκρὸβυστος, πάσης ἀνωμαλίας πραγμά·
των ἀνῃρημένης· εἶτα συλλογιζόμενός
φησιν, κ.τ.λ.; and both with the
Latin.
