the MSS.

xvj , THE oRIGmAL COMMENTARY, &c-

evidence has not been accessible during the preparation of the
present work. The sources from which this edition has been
derived are the Corbie and Harley MSS„ the printed compilation
of Rabanus, excerpts from the Latin version in the works of
other compilers from the 8th to the 12th century, and the Greek
fragments of the original, published in Cramer's Catenae, and
collated anew with the MS. in the Bibliotheque Nationale.

The present is the first complete issue os the Latin version.
An edition was commenced by Prof. Jacobi shortly after his
discovery of the true authorship, in the form of a series of Uni·
versity “programme8,'' of which the first six, printed at Halle in
the years 1855, 1856, 1858, 1860, 1866 and 1872 respectively,
contained the commentary on Philippians‚ Colossians, 1 and
2 Thessalonians and 1 Tim. c. i. Dr Jacobi's text was based on
a comparison of Pitra, Rabanus and Cramer, aided by occasional
conJectural emendationS, of which many are strikingly confirmed
by a fuller examination of the MS. authorities, The learned editor
had intended to complete his work so far as to embrace in it
as much of the commentary as had not been printed in extenso
by Cardinal Pitra¹3 but on ascertaining that the present edition
had been undertaken, he courteously refrained from proceeding
with-his design.
