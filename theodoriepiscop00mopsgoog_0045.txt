INTEGRITY, PECULIARITIES, AND HISTORY
OF THE LATIN TRANSLATION.

My next business is to ascertain how far the Latin· version
may be trusted as a faithful representation of the lost original„
1 shall also endeavour to answer certain questions connected
with its literary character and history.

By comparing with the translation the Greek extract» in Relation
Cramer's catena we are enabled to form some estimate of osthe- ,
the fidelity of both catenist and translator. As we might have 3531}ss ⁵
expected, the former has usually abridged his original by omitting ‘2⁸33ss
words, paragraphS, or larger portions of the text (Gal. ii. 20 3 ongu ⁶
iii. 19, 23, 27, 28; iv. 1—-3, 6, 15, 21, 303 v. 163 vi. 163
Eph. arg. ; i. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 17 ; ii. 16, δια), less frequently by
remodelling sentences (e. g. GaL iv. 24 3 vi. 25 Col. i. 15 ; 1 Tim.

v. 3). osan attempt to explain a difficulty by paraphrasing Ι hove
noticed a very occasional instance (e. g. on Tit. i. 12, 13, where

κότι seems to have been substituted for the more obscure phrase
ἀποδέχεσθαι τᾶν ποιητήν αἶς ἂν...εἷρηκότα). Generally speaking,
the catenist appears to have confined himself to Theodore's words ;
and he has thus frequently assisted toward the correction of the
errors into which the translator or his copyist had fallen, or has
supplied what was wanting in the Latin (Gal. i. 15, 16 ; ii. 20 3
iii. 423 iv. 293 vi. 173 Eph. i. 103 13, 145 ii. 14—-163 iv. 43
Phil. i. 1, 23 ii. 73 iii. 4, 153 Col. ii. 18, ²33 iii. 23; 1 Thess.
iv. 17, δια).
Of the substantial integrity of the translation as it appears Sub-

in our MSS., th'ere is no reason to entertain any doubt. Here stantial

and there a line has dropt out through homoeoteleuton ,· occasionally oritt‘ixgengtin
a word or two may have been overlooked by the translator himself mmmmm
(e. g. καὶ τῆς ἀθανασίας, Gal. iii. 43 καὶ οἰκονόμους, iv. 1—-3-‚ 3„
ἔτι τότε, iv. 24 3 ἔξωθεν, 1 Tim. iii. 14, 153 διδασκαλίαν, iv. 13).
But judging from the unbroken sense of the Latin, and from a
comparison with the Greek in such longer extracts as afford a·
