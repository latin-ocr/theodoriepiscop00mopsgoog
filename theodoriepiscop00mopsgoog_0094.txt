· state3 it can be obtained only through the grace of the Spirit,

and in its perfection it belongs to that future world which our
saith contemplate5‚ and where we hope to be free from all mu-
tability and death (Rom. ix. 32, 333 Gal. ii. 13, 163 iv. 24,
Tit. iii. 6, 7). Meanwhile, through the operation of the Holy
Spirit, we are enabled to mould our mortal life into an imitation
of the deathless state into which we have been symbolically
admitted (Rom. vi. 12—143 Tit. ii. 13, 14). Frequent Com-
munion‚ preceded by a caseful examination of the mind, is
incumbent on all who seek this end. In the Holy Mysteries the
faithful receive [the Body and] Blood of Christ, present therein by
virtue of a spiritual change. All the benefits which result from
the Death os the Lord are thus conveyed to penitent recipientS,
especially the forgiveness of past sinS, however great, and the co-
operation of the Spirit in their endeavours to attain to amendment
of life (1 Cor. x. 3—53 xi. 28, 34). Nothing but deadly and habitual
sin should deter the baptized from this most fruitful means os grace.
(viii) The παρουσία is the great hope of the Church and of creation
(Col. iii. 4 3 1 Thess. ii. 19). Our Lord's mission is repeatedly
represented by S. Paul as finding its realization in the future life
(Gal. iii. 23, Eph. i. 3, 4 , ii. 7). When He appears„ the work of
the Spirit will attain its perfection. Then will have come the
moment of our truer regeneration (Gal. iv. 24). By the power of
the Spirit the body will be raised, and endowed with immortality
(Rom. viii. 23 Gal. iii. 33 vi. 183 Eph. i. 4, Phil. i. 19) ; our
adoption (Rom. viii. 193 . Gal. iii. 27, 28) and our translation
into the Kingdorn of the Adopted Son (Col. i. 13) will then at
length be perfected. Further, we shall be set free from the vicissi-
tudes of mortality, and thenceforth guarded by the full indwelling
of the Spirit from the possibility of a relapse (Gal. ii. 15, 16).
We shall then need no law, because being immortal we shall
no longer be in danger of falling into sin (Rom. v. 17 , ix.
32, 333 1 Cor. xv. 563 Gal. iv. 1——33 v. 173 Eph. i. 183
Col. i. 22, ἰὶἰ. 5, 1 Tim. i. 9). Nor will our blesseducss be
merely negative ; the perpetual presence in us os the Spirit of
grace will be the pledge of all good things (Gal. iv. ²93 Eph. i.
13, 14). Union with Christ and with God‚ union in Christ and
in God with our sellowmen and with all creation, enjoymcut
of the Divine glory‚ an insatiable love os virtue and the power
to attain to it without pain or toil, an eterna] abode with Christ
in Heaveu—-these are amongst the elements of the perfectiou
