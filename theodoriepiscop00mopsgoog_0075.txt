OF Tffls COMMENTARY. lxv

cause of our author’s peculiar manner in the character of the
man rather than in his circumstances or education. An ardent *
and ingenious mind, possessed by a crowd of ideas¹, which
it had hardly strength enough firmly to grasp or thoroughly to
work out, and, in spite of its originality and sincerity, haunted
by occasional doubts as to the trustworthiness of its own con-
clusions, and a hazy uncertainty as to their exact scope and
issue ², would go far to produce a style of writing such as Theo-
dore's critics have detected in his works. His literary faults ·
were but the reflection of mental imperfectioris which to some
extent vitiate his work as well as its style, his theology no less
than the form in which it is cast. Yet they will easily be condoned
by those who realize the fearless honesty, the prodigious industry,

and the unquestionable power with which these defects are more
than redeemed.

It has been remarked by O. F. F rit'zsche2‚ that whilst Theo· Fritzsche’s
dore is happiest in the interpretation of the New Testament, {ffssff‘effit
his exposition of the Pauline Epistles is the least satisfactory of dore as an
his labours in that field. His genius was not adapted to the work ξξῐέῗᾛὲἑι
of following the complicated reasoning and abstruse dogmatic
teaching of S. Paul. His treatment of the Epistles is grammatical
rather than theologica13 as a theological expositor he yields the
palm to his friend Chrysostom.

This criticism, written more than forty years ago, rests almost Reasons
exclusively upon the fragments supplied by Cramer's catena. No sor fg·
portion of Theodore's work was then accessible in its entirety. At ἳιιιξ sall?-
the present time ten complete parts out of fourteen are in our handS, 1⁶⁶²·
amounting probably to about one—half of the whole commentary.
Under these circumstances there can be no presumption in re-
opening the question of Theodore's capacity and achievements
as a commentator upon S. Paul.

Of our author's careful attention to the language of the Epis- Theo-

tles there is abundant evidence. (a) He repeatedly stops to ῗξέξέζίξῧξέ
