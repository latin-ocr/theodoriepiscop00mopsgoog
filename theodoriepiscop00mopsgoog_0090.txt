uncircumscribed (Eph. i. 22, 2 3), invisible (Col. i. 15), im·
mutable (1 Tim. i. 113 vi. 16). In the Old Testament the
Name of God represents the Divine Essence (Heb. i. 12); the
Gospel reveals the Persons of the , Son and of the Holy Ghost
as distinct from the Person of the Father although in essence
inseparable from Him (Eph. iv. 6). The coequal and con-
substantial Deity of the Word (Phil. ii. 73 1 Thess i. 10) is
firmly and repeatedly maintained 3 a⁰nd the Holy Spirit, if less
frequently, is not less directly declared to be Very God (Eph. vi.
17). (ii) The κόσμος, which Theodore identifies with Creation
(Rom. viii. 193 1 Cor. ii. 12), is regarded as an organic body,
whose members are partly rational and invisible, partly visible
and obJ'ects of sense. Originally (Rom. viii. 195 Eph. i. 10), this
body, notwithstanding the diversity of its component partS, was at
peace within itself. AngeIS, the invisible and intelligent powers of
creation, were entrusted with the administration of the visible
universe, which they moved and controlled in the interests of
man (Eph. i. 103 ii. 2 ; Col. i. 16). Man, made of elements
belonging to both sides of creation, was designed to bea bond

nature its opposite factors (Rom. viii. 19 3 Eph. i. 10 3 Col. i. 16),
to the intent that the universe might with one accord serve its
Creator and obey His laws. (iii) In man as he came from the
hands of God there was already the germ of possible disunion,
since he was from the first liable to death (Gal. ii. 15, 16). Yet
he might have continued immortal by continuing obedient (Gal. i.
4). Death‚ as a matter of fact, supervened in consequence of
Adam’s disobedience (Rom. viii. 19 ; Eph. i. 103 Col. i. 16).
Two results followed from our fall. (a) The union of the visible
creation with the invisible was dissolved by the separation of
body and soul in man. The angels were alienated from man,
both by reason of his decline from God W hom they still obeyed‚
and because the material side of his nature no longer preserved
its oneness with the spiritual. Thus their control over the visible
world, hitherto exercised for man’s advantage, was in danger of
belng abandoned, and the harmony of the κόσμος completely
broken up (Rom. viii. 19 ; Eph. i. 105 Col. i. 16). (b) With
regard to man himself, the ingress of mortality gave occasion
to ever fresh acts of disobedience, for it introduced a new state
of being—this present mortal life (Gal. i. 4), in which perfection
is impossible. Mortality gives rise to weakncss and mutability
