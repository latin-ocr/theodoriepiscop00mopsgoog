THE ORIGINAL COMMENTARY‚
ITS FRAGMENTS AND TRANSLATIONS.

ΤΗΑΤ the exegetical writings of Theodore, Bishop of Mop- Theodore

suestia, included commentaries upon some at least of the Epistles 31ῐέξέὮῖ

of S. Paul is attested by writers who had access to the original S. Pau .

work. The evidence of Theodoret¹ is ambiguous 3 but S. Cyril
of Alexandria, as quoted by Facundus', distinctly credits Theodore
with an exposition of the Apostolic Epistles. In the next century
Facundus himself cites⁸ the commentary on the Epistle to the
Romans, and Pope Vigilius⁴ contributes an extract from Theo-
dore's remarks on Hebl i. 9. The commentary on Hebrews is
also mentioned by Leontius of Byzantium⁸, who adds that
Theodore wrote upon the Epistles to the Corinthians and Gala-
tians. After the sixth century there seems to be no further trace
in ecclesiastical literature os any reference to the original of these
