death. And, as far as I can judge, having regard to the great uncer-
tainty which prevails as to the nature and extent of Jerome's
work upon the latter part of the New T estament, the text with
which our translator was sarniliar must have been more or less
fully influenced by the revision which is connected with his
name. It contains renderings which appear to be peculiar to
the revised text, e. g. sorte uocati (Eph. i. 1 1), cogitationum (ii. 3),
carissimi (Phil. ii. 12), festinantius ergo (ii. 28); and others which
though not admitted by Jerome into the text of the Vulgate were
adopted or suggested by him in his own workS, such as incedunt
(Gal. ii. 14), ministrat [Hieron. adua] (iii. 5), fermentat (v. 9),
laborem milei nemo adhibeat [Hieron. labores .. exhibeat] (vi. 1 7),
recapitulare (Eph. i. 10), arra [Hieron. arrhabo] (i. 14), donantes
uobis ipsis [Hieron. uobismetipsis] (iv. 32), omnia arma (vi. 1 1).
On the other hand our translation exhibits a great preponderance
of ante-Hieronymian renderings over those admitted or proposed
by Jerome. The following list of Old Latin renderings from the

text of the Epistle to the Ephesians is offered as a sample os the
indebtedness os our translator to the unrevised Vulgate. I have
in each case added to the rendering the names os Latin fathers
who used the Vetus Latina or Itala, and in whose works the
particular word or phrase is also found. Eph. i. 4, coram eo

I now turn to the history of this interesting translation. My
first endeavour will be to trace its circulation in the Latin Church

up to the end of the twelfth century.
