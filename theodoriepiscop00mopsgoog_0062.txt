entant writers who quote it, to S. Ambrose. We may thus
eliminate from the list of possible translators such staunch oppo-
nents as Marius Mercator, whose scanty excerpts from Theodore ¹
are carefully branded with the author’s name²: and perhaps also
such sound Catholics as CassiodoruS, wh0, if he had thought the
commentary as a whole worthy of translation by his Greek-leving
friends⁸, would assuredly have taken the precaution of warning
the West against its heterodoxy⁴. Dismissing these from our
field of enquiry we will seek for the author of the version amongst
sympathizers of the Nestorian or of the Pelagian school, or
amongst those Catholics who sought to vindicate the orthodoxy
of Theodore from the aspersions os Justinian.

(a) In the last decade of his life Theodore was brought into
lator ¹¹²²? contact with several of the followers of Pelagius, who upon their
ἓξιὲἳιὲἕιῐξε expulsion from Italy sought refuge with the Bishop of Mopsuestia⁶.
(α) Pelagi· Among these was Julian of Eclanum—a Greek scholar, according to
ans. Gennadius⁰, and a warni admirer of Theodore's writings⁷. Another

Pelagian, the deacon AnianuS, is identified by Garnier and Mont-
faucon⁸ with the translator of S. Chrysostom's Homilies on S. Mol-

would ascribe the ancient version os

17, 2222; the version is printed in

⁴ Comp. what Cassiodorus says as
to Origcn (inst. i) and Tichonius (ih.

less have received a similar treatment,
or it might have been expurgated in
translation. But the Latin Theodore
bears no marks os either process.
