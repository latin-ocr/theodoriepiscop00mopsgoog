xiv THE ORIGINAL. COMMEETARY‚

· As far back as the end of the seventeenth century (1686-90),
the Benedictine editors, of S. Ambrose, in their preface to the
commentary of the Ambrosian Hilary, had called attention to the
circumstance that a MS. formerly belonging to the monastery of
Corbie contained a Latin commentary identical with. the Ambro-
siaster's on the Epistles 'to the Romans and Corinthiam, but
altogether distinct from, the latter and from every other known
exposition in its treatment of· the remaining nine Epistles ¹. The
researches of Dom (now cardinal) J. B. Pitra led him to a
careful examination. of this MS. 3 and believing himself to have
found, in it a genuine work of S. Hilary of Poitiers‚ he pub-
lished in 1852 ⁹ the commentary on Galatians Ephesians and

 

Philemon entire, together with a collation of the commentar-y on .

the intervening Epistles with the copious and almost continuons
extracts from it which the Benedictines had already⁸ detected in
the· printed compilation of Rabanus Maurus, where they appeared,
as, in the Corbie MS„ under the name of Ambrose. Pitra's pub·
lication was accompanied by an elaborate defence of his theory
as to the authorship of the new-found exposition 3 and this theory,

was accepted by more than one of his reviewers ⁴.

euces are however too brief, and too
much abbreviated and otherwise ma-
nipulated by Barcephas to be of any
critical value3 but they are interesting
as establishing a probability that these
commentaries were accessible to a
Jacobite Bishop of Mosul at the end
os the 9th ot beginning of the roth
century.

that Reinkens (Hilarius von Poitiers‚
