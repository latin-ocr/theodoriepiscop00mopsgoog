‘⁴ 448. Dd. viii. 14. A folio, on parchment, of 292 leaves and a
fragment, in double columns, of from 36 to 42 lines each, of
the xiith century. The initial letters are illuminated, ‘Roberti
Prioris de Berlintona¹ compilationes in epistolas Pauli Apostoli '.”
Another copy of the same work exists in the Library of Emmanuel
College (Coll. Emm. MS. 1. 1. 8). Like the University MS„
it is a folio, in double columnS, with illuminated initial letters,
The general condition of this MS. is excellent, but the first page
has suffered at some earlier stage of its history through the loss

Robert of Bridlington, the author of this book, flourished in
the second half of the twelsth century⁸, when he was the fourth
Prior of the Augustinian house at Bridlington. To the biographers

lectione exercuit ut uniuersum fere orbern Latinorum theologorum

the Pentateuch, the PsalmS, the Minor ProphetS, the Gospels of·
SS. Matthew and John, and the Apocalypse, besides the Epistles
of S. Paul.
In the prologue to the' present volume the compilet thus
speaks of the occasion and method of his work:

Dei et ad petentium fratrum utilitatem composui, ita multae
