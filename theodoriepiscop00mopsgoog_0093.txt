This ineffable union (Eph. v. 32) is brought about by the Spirit
of Christ in the spiritual regeneration of Baptism (Rom. vi. 173
xiii. 143 Gal. ii. 15, 163 v. 253 Eph. i. 233 iv. 4, 22—243
Col. i. 18 3 Tit. iii. 6), which is at once a type and symbol of our
sellowship in the Death and Resurrection of the Lord (Rom. vi.
173 Gal. ii. 15, 163 Eph. i. 23), an incorporation into the Church
or congregation of the faithful (Rom. xiii. 143 Eph. i. 22, 233
iv. 4, 16 3 Col. i. 18), and a new birth into that immortal and sinless
life into which Christ Himself has passed (Gal. ii. 15, 16, δια).
It is not, however, the water of Baptism which draws down upon
the baptized this gift of grace in its fulneSS, but the saith of the
receiver3 the Holy Spirit will not rest on any who receive this
Sacrament without the proper dispositions (1 Tim. iii. 2), and
thuS, whether baptized in infancy or in riper age, the members of
Christ must be careful to live according to the grace they have
received (Rom. vi. 173 Col. ii. 15 3 1 Tim. iii. 2). Baptism apart
from effort and diligence will not produce the fruits of virtue, even
if it may be said to convey the remission of sins (1 Tim. iii. 6).
NevertheleSS, great are the blessings of Baptism3 without it we
cannot receive the Holy Spirit (ι Tim. iii. 6); in it we obtain
the first gift os His grace, the firstfruits and earnest os the im-
mortal life which we are hereafter to share with Christ (Gal. iii.
13, 143 Eph. i. 13, 143 22, 233 Col. ii. 123 1 Thess. iv. 8).
The Holy Spirit, Who is the Spirit os the Son, yet co-essential
and co-eternal with the Father (Rom. viii. 11), Who anointed the
Man Christ at His Baptism (Heb. i. 9) and Whose grace was

received by Him sor man at His Ascension (Eph. iv. 9), is the
Agent of our entire restoration,· from the new birth of the font
to the final entrance on eternal life (Rom. viii. 2 3 Gal. ii. 15, 16 5
et passim). In the present state (ξ iii. b) the regenerate occupy a
kind of border-land between two worldS, the present and the future
(Gal. ii. 15, 16 5 ἰίἰ. 203 v. 2 5). By virtue of our regeneration and
union with Christ we have already passed into the future life
(Gal. v. ²4) 5 we already enjoy the adoption of sonS, which consists
in the gift of immortality (Rom. viii. 15: Gal. iii. 27, 283 iv. 5) 3
we already possess the sanctisying power of the Spirit (1 Cor. vi.
11). Yet at present we are sons of God by anticipation rather
than in actual fruition (Rom. viii. 15 3 Gal. ii. 16) 3 we are infants
in the life of the Spirit (Rom. viii. 15 3 Gal. ii. 16) 5 we are justified
only by saith. Justification by the works of the law or by works
os any kind is impossible, by reason os the weakness of our mortal
