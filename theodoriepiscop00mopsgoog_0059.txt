or THE LATIN TRANSLArroN. xlix

clear, therefore, that at this time the Abbey of Fulda possessed
a MS. in which a portion of the Latin Theodore appeared under
the name of Ambrose. It is equally certain that in this MS.
the work of Ambrosiaster was carried on to the end of EphesianS,
his place being usurped by Theodore only in the eight following
epistleS. Whilst Sedulius had access to the Latin Theodore
on Galatiam», in the Fulda ‘Ambrose’ Theodore did not begin
before Philippians. The fact is remarkable as shewing that
the substitution of Theodore for Ambrosiaster had in some
copies been partial, in others coextensive with the limits of our
translation. Are we to inser that the translation, if by the sanie
hand throughout, was not all produced at the same time, the
commentary on Galatians and Ephesians being the first instal-
ment of the work, and the remainder having originally followed
by itself? Or did the translator begin with the Epistle to the
philippians, perhaps because the commentary on this and the
following Epistles offered more abundant illustrations of Theo-
dore's peculiar theology? In any case, we have in the work of
Rabanus distinct evidence that, so far as the last⁰eight epistles
are concerned, the Latin translation had found its way to Germany
in connexion with the commentary of Ambrosiaster before the
middle of the ninth century.
