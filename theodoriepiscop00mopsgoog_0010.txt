vi PREFACE.

Library, Cambridge, for assistance of various kinds liberally
rendered to me in the course of my labourS. To Mr Bensly,
Fellow and Lecturer in Hebrew and Syriae of Gonville and Caius
College‚ I owe the first suggestion of the work ; he has moreover
revised the Syriae quotations in my Introduction and noteS,
and offered an occasional criticism upon the Latin text. The
proof-sheets of the first two Epistles and of a great part of the
third have been read through by Mr wallis, Fellow and Lec-
turer in Divinity of the same College3 and to his vigilance Ι
am indebted for not a few important correctionS, together
with suggestions which have here and there, in passages

ambiguous or corrupt, set me upon the track of Theodore’s or
his translator’s meaning.

Notwithstanding this kind help, I have osten been at a loss
to penetrate the obscurity as well of the translation as os the
original work. In the addenda a list will be found of pas-
sages where, upon fuller consideration, 1 have been led to
prefer another reading or explanation to the one which had
been hazarded when the sheets were printed off. Other errors
or dubious points may remain3 and Ι shall thankfully add to
the second volume any emendations of the text or corrections
os the notes with which 1 may be favoured.

It remains sor me only to express my grateful sense of
the liberality with which the Syndics of the University
Prcss undertook, at my request, the publication of my book;
and the uniform courtesy and unwearicd attention which
the officials os the Press have displaycd during the pro-gress of
the work. ·
