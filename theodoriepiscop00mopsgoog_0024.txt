matter< is arranged· throughout in double columns3 the text of
the Epistles„ embedded- in the commentar-5, is distinguished by
semi-zmeial characters, Each Epistle is headed by a rectangular
band or fillet consisting of devices in red, green, biae, and yellow3
and the initia] letter of the text in each is similarly ornamented.
There is no other omamentation. The Epistles with the com-
mentary occupy the following leaves respectively: Galatians, ff.
1 a—-461b33 Ephesiam, 46 b—108 b3 Philippians‚ 109 a--138b 3.

-313 b are filled by an anonymous and imperfect θεωρία upon. the
T abernacle²‚ which seems to have been added by way of an
appendix to the commentary on Hebrews ix.

F our of the Epistles are followed by colophons smting the
sources from which the catenist has borrowed. At the end' of
Ephesians we read: τῶν εἷς τήν πρὸς Ἐφεσίους ἐπιστολήν Παύλου

Eusebius of Emisa contributes about a dozen short extractS, whilst
SS. AthanasiuS, Basil, and Gregory of NazianzuS‚ are each quoted
once. There are also some twelve anonymous fragments which
apparently are not due to Theodore. Origen is largely quoted on
the Epistle to the Ephesians, but his name does not occur else-
where. Thus, with the exception of the Epistle to the Ephesiam,
this catena is, as far as regards the Epistles covered by the Latin
version of Theodore‚ almost exclusively derived from the writings
of the four Antiochene expositorS‚ EusebiuS, Chrysostom, Se-
verianuS, and Theodore. Of these Chrysostom largely pre-
