oF ‘rffls COMMENTARY. lxiii

taries on the Pauline Epistles were written at the instance of six
friends, The commentary on Romans was addressed to one
Eusebius the commentary on Corinthians to a namesake Theo-
dorus3 Eustratius elicited the exposition of the Epistles to the
GalatianS, EphesianS, PhilippianS, and Colossians3 whilst we owe
the commentary on Thessalonians to a James, that on Timothy
to a Peter, that on Titus and Philemon to a CyrinuS, who
seems also to have drawn forth the commentary on the Epistle
to the Hebrews. This account receives some confirmation from
the language os Theodore himself in the argument of his com-
mentary on Philemon¹. If trustworthy, it suggests that the com-
mentaries followed one another at varying intervals of time.
With the exception of the Epistle to the Hebrew3‚ the Epis'tles
seem to have been treated in the order in which they now stand.
The Epistles to the Romans and to the Hebrews were among the
first to be dealt with (comm. on Gal. iii. 2 33 iv. 24); Galatians
preceded Ephesians (Eph. i. 4), Philippians and “nearly all ” the
other Epistles came before the first Epistle to Timothy (1 Tim. i.
3, 43 iii. 8), the first Epistle to Timothy before the Epistle to
Titus (Tit. i. 5). The commentary upon the Epistle to Philemon
with its singularly interesting and valuable argument may perhaps
be regarded as the crowning effort of the Interpreter's expository

power.

Theodore's style did not escape the censures of the great Theodore’s

continual and apposite references to Scripture, blames his (1)
obscurity, (2) diffuseness‚ (3) harshness and want of grace. He
