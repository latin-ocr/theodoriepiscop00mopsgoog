one side of the leaf with a hard· point, with double bounding
lines on both inner and outer margin.

The writing is in Lombardic minuscules of the⁵ 9th century.
There are two hands: the first occupying the five unsigned
quires to the middle of the last page, where it is replaced by
the second which continues to the end of the volume. The first
hand is the bolder, and, in some respects, the more elegant 3 the
other rather heavier, but very even and regular. The spaces
which separate the wordS, though narrow, are sufficient. The con-
tractions are of the ordinary character3 and, as is usual at this
period, generally occur in the sacred names and titles and in
words of common use.

The system of punctuation varies slightly in the two hands·-
In the first, in common use are the fullpoint generally placed in
the middle of the line of writing, a short horizontal curve or tick,
and the comma. The second hand uses the fullpoint, the inverted
comma or oblique upstroke, the semicolon, simple and inverted,
and the comma or 7-shaped stop. The comma or 7 is the
highest power. The punctuation at the beginning of the volume
has in places been altered by a later hand.

The text has been corrected by contemporary handS, and also
by a hand using Caroline letters of the roth century. A hand
of the roth century has likewise marked in the margins passages
to be copied or read as lessons¹. A few other marginal marks
of an early date by readers or correctors also occur. The only
notes of later times are some which are written in the margins
of the Epistle to the Ephesians by an Italian hand late in the
14th century.
