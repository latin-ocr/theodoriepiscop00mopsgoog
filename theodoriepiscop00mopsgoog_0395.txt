comm. as represented in our MSS. is
scarcely less ambiguous than the text;
nor is the Gk. of the catena free from
difficulty. In the latter 1 have ventured
to change τινὰς into nni—the following
τῶν διδασκ. is enough to account for the
catenist’s substitution of the plura13 whilst
in the Latin, uidentur and habeant—due,

1 think, to the influence of the clause ut

haec tradantur—have been conformed to
the Gk. (δοκεῖ...ἔχειν). Quasi qui...eos
should perhaps be read quasi quia...ii,· or
uero should be omitted, and the sentence
run: “ quasi quia.. .eos. . .ostendit; quasi,
&c.” But here the confusion is probably
due to the translator, and I have there-
fore left the text of the MSS. unchanged.
Th.’s meaning is: “S. Paul intends to
say that the delivery of these minute pre-
cepts (v. τι) passed among the Colossians
as a proof of the superior knowledge and
deep humility os the salse teachers.‘’

3. ostendit uero, δια] Ut haec tra-
dantur is still the subject os the sentence.

‘ These prohibitions prove them to be
sels-denying persons, wh0‚ scorning to
provide for the wants of the body,
practise continual sels-restraint in obe-
dience to the traditions of the law!
Lightfoot: “The words οὐκ ἐν τιμῇ τινὶ
πρὸς πλησμονὴν τῆς σαρκός are regarded
[according to one line os interpretation]
as an exposition of the doctrine of the
salse teachers from their own point of
view. So Theodore os Mopsuestia...This
able expositor however is evidently dis-
satisfied, for he introduces his explana-
tion with the words ἀσαφὲς μέν ἐστι,
κ.τ.λ. 3 and his explanation has not been
adopted by others. Either the sentence
so interpreted becomes flat and unmean-
ing...or the Apostle is made to confirm
the value os the very doctrines which he
is combating.’'

Here miserabilitas seems to represent

ταπεινότης or τὸ raa-emim cf. p. 298,
