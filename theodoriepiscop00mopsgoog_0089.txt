COMMENTARIES ΟΝ THE EPISTLES 01² S. PAUL. lxxix

and in varied and massive learnitig he is unquestionably superior
to the Bishop of Mopsuestia. But Jerome lays no claim to origin-
ality, or rather he repudiates the claim at the very outset of his
commentasy on the Galatiam. His work is a digest of his vast
reading, principally based, as he tells us, on the labours of Origen.
The whole is doubtless moulded and coloured by his own genius,
and is thus placed above the level of a mere compilation. But it
is the product of a scholar's eruditiori, rather than of an inde-
pendent· interpreter’s thought; and this fact alone distinguishes
Jerorne’s commentaries from Theodore’s. The latter makes no
display os learning, and scarce ever refers to other writers except
for the purpose os resuting their views. He aims at 'expounding
S. Paul, rather than at illustrating him; he brings little to his task

. beyond a particular method and a system os doctrine 3 he trusts

to his author to supply the rest. The result is not a learned
commentary, but a thoughtful exposition. Each has its place in
the exegetical literature of the Church; and whilst we could ill
afford to lose the ripe fruits of S. Jerome's prodigious industry‚
they are sar from rendering the expository work of Theodore*
superfluous even where the two commentators have travelled over
the same ground.

DOCTRINAL SYSTEM OF THEODORE AS
EXHIBITED IN HIS EXPOSITION OF S. PAUL.

The doctrinal peculiarities os Theodore have been treated at
some length by N eander and Domer¹. It does not lie within the
province of this Introduction to attempt a complete examination
os his system of theology‚ although with the increased materials
which we now possess such a work might perhaps be profitably
undertaken. My present business is to collect and arrange the
outlines of Theodore's doctrine so far as it is developed in his

commentaries upon the Pauline EpistleS.
