lxxii RELA‘rroN or ‘rms COMMENTARY To o‘rHER

passages I have shewn reason to suppose that amongst the writers

thus attacked are possibly Origen, Chrysostom, Severianus, and

Pelagius3 and if this be 50, Theodore may at least receive

credit for impartiality. Once or twice he holds the balance al-

= most evenly between the opposite views of contemporaries (Gal.

ii. 11—14; Eph. v. 14); but as a rule his own opinion is given

in unmistakeable terms, and he is not afraid to stand almost or
altogether alone.

Qualified That he was occasionally indebted to other commentators is

ἓζξξω probable enough. As to Origen, a comparison of the fragments
{1323th gom, of his expositions of S. Paul¹ with the translated Theodore shews

Eusebius but few coincidenceS, and those chiefly in points of grammar and
Emjs„ Se· punctuation'3 the exegesis usually differs altogether. Eusebius os
ξ’ὲξζξῗζ Emisa († c. 359) may have suggested some of our author’s re-
soptom, marks on the Epistle to the Galatians either directly or through
D¹⁰d⁰¹'⁶· Diodore, who is said by S. Jerome to have followed in Eusebius’s
steps⁸. SeverianuS, if we may judge of his work by the extracts in
Cramer, was often at one with Theodore⁴3 but the coincidences
are probably due to the connexion of both writers with the same
exegetical schooL With regard to his friend Chrysostom⁵, whilst
Theodore is frequently on the same lines with him (e.g. in com-
menting on Gal. iv. 17 ; v. 23 3 Eph. iv. 6 3 vi. 243 Phil. ii. 163 iii. 2 ;
Col. i. 203 iv. 163 2 Thess. ii. 3, 4), their explanations are nearly
as often distinct, and sometimes they are opposite (Phil. iii. 193
Col. i. 13, 15, &e.). His debt to their common master Diodore
is probably greater, and its extent can be tested up to a certain
point. Diodore wrote commentaries on S. Paul' which were
extant in S. Jerome's time, but were afterwards destroyed, it is
said, by Arian intolerance. A few fragments of his commentary
on the Epistle to the Romans have been preserved, and are
printed in Cramer's Catena. It happens that in several instances'
fragments of Theodore's expositions of the same passages sur·
vive3 on the next page I give the results of a comparison where
it has thus become possible.
