COMMENTARIES ΟΝ THE EPISTLES OF S. PAUL. lxxvii

Theodore's matter in his own words3 and though his commen-
tary often supplies a key to the meaning of the translation,
where the latter is obscured by the bungling of the translator
or the mistakes of copyistS, it would usually be unsafe to at-
tempt the restoration of Theodore’s Greek sro'm the pages of
his pupil. (ii) It is not indiscriminate. Theodoret, whose com-
mentary was perhaps written after the Council of Ephesus, holds
aloof from the speculations of Theodore when they would have
led him away from the Catholic saith. This will be· clear from
a comparison of the two commentaries in almost any crucial

passage, e. g. Phil. ii. 6, sq.; Col. i. 13, sq.; 1 Tim. iii. 16. Everr
in matters unconnected with doctrine Theodoret shews himself
capable of steering his own course, although he professes to be
but a humble follower of “the holy fathers.”

A few words may be added as to the position which Theodore Theodore
occupies amongst extant ancient commentators upon the Epistles ³⁵ a Com·

out, as we have seen, by the actual divergence os their lines of
interpretation. Our author seldom or never rises into the sphere
of the mystical. He is penetrated by the same spirit of gram-
matical precision, but he lacks both the critical discernment and
the spiritual power of Origen. Yet he speaks with more authority
than the great Alexandriam he takes a more definite aim. Origen
approaches the sacred text as a seeker after truth; T heodore, as
one who has already found the key of knowledge and who, thus
furnished, proceeds to unlock the treasures of S. Paul's teaching
with almost entire confidence in the result.

(b)' With S. Chrysostom and Theodoret Theodore naturally (h)S.Chry-
has much in common3 and the three principal representatives of διῖῖὶᾟῶἒζὶ
the exegetical school of Antioch agree, as we have seen, both in
their treatment of many crucial passages, and in their general style.
Nevertheless, each has a sphere and a manner of his own. The
homiletic character of S. Chrysostom's expositionS, manifested

even in his formal commentary on the Epistle to the Galatiam, is
