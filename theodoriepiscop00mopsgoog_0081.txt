oF 'rins COMMENTARY. lxxi

whilst in the choice of a reading he is guided only by a subjective
notion of what the sense or sequence requires. It is on this
ground that in Eph. v. 14, he dismisses the reading ἐπιφαύσει σου
ὅ Χριστός, and in Phil. i. 1, prefers σῦν ἐπισκόποις to συνεπισκόποις.
So far so good5 but the same reason is held sufficient to justify the
change of πατριοί into φρατρία in Eph. iii. 15. In one remarkable
instance (Eph. ii. 22) he carelessly substitutes ἁφή for οἷκοὸομῆζ
and then proceeds in complete unconsciousness to extract a mean·
ing out of his own blunder.‘

On the whole the chief ‚value of Theodore’s commentaries Summary.
on S. Paul consists in their constant endeavour to expound the
sequence of the thought, their careful examination of the clauses
and phraseology‚ their frequent dashes of characteristic and
suggestive exegesis, the light they occasionally throw on the
condition of the Eastern Church at the beginning of the fifth
century, and perhaps not least, the clear and well nigh complete
view which they present of the Antiochene theology both in its

indebtedness to, and in its divergence from, the theology of
S. Paul.
