lxxxvi noc‘rRmAL SYSTEM or·- THEoDoRE

partly from the representations of his enemies. 1 have usually
been able to· illustrate the doctrinal statements of the text from
one or other of these sources: and it will be observed that the
author himself frequently refers to some earlier work, especially to
his commentary upon the great dogmatic Epistle to the Romana
But if Cardinal Pitra’s discovery does not add much to the
extent of our knowledge of Theodore’s doctrinal system, at least
it enables us to verify previous impressions and to fill up missing
links, by presenting the whole in a more continuous form than it
assumes elsewhere. The commentary on the minor Prophets is
the only other work of the great Interpreter which remains in its
integrity3 and it is of comparatively little dogmatic interest.
Hitherto our view of his teaching has been chiefly drawn from
fragments the preservation of which is due to the arbitrary choice
of catenists or to the animus of bitter opponentS. In this work at
length Theodore speaks for himself without interruption3 and the
subject compels him to traverse almost the whole field of Christian
doctrine.
Remarks The relation of Theodore’s doctrine to the teaching of the
⁰¹¹ T‚heo- Church on the one hand, and of various heretical leaders
{lict'iroensalsoa on the other, has been too often discussed to need any fresh
‘esther‘ examination here. I shall content myself with calling attention
to two points which have been impressed upon me by the study of
the present Commentary.
His de· (i) That Theodore’s teaching, or rather perhaps the Antiochene
arturgs theology of which he was the ripest exponent, contained in itsels
sg‘ssffigfsshe the germs of manisold departures from the Catholic saith, it is
ggffl‘gffin- impossible to doubt. A suggestive writer in the Churclz Quarterly
conscious. Review (Oct. 1875) has pointed out that some os the most recent
developments of unbelief are but the working out of principles
enunciated in the fifth century by the Bishop of Mopsuestia 3 and
the connexion which the reviewer has traced between “ Theodore

and Modern Thought” might be found in other tendencies besides

those which he has noticed. NevertheleSS, every accession to our Α

knowledge of Theodore, and this not the least, adds strength to
the conviction that he was entirely unconscious of deviating
from the doctrine of the Catholic Church. So far is he from being
a wilful heretic‚ that it is the very vigour of his opposition to
recognized heresies which leads him astray. His Christology is
meant to be a safeguard against Apollinarianism 3 his sympathy
with Pelagius arises from a dread of fatalisrn3 his rejection
