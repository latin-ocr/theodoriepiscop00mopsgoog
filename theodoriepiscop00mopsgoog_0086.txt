Several of these commentS, indeed, are found also in S. Chry-
sostom, and one or.two in other and earlier Greek writers, from
whom Pelagius may have borrowed thern. But it is not so easy to
account for the coincidences in the doctrinal statements marked
(d), (f) [in part], (g), and (lz). The last os these, in particular,
advances a view denounced by Chrysostom, and, as far as Ι know,
peculiar in their own age to Pelagius and Theodore. Moreover,
in both commentaries it is supported by a reference to Exod. iv.
22. Now the commentary of Pelagius is known to have been
written before the year 410, and while he was yet at Rome, where
Theodore’s work would scarcely have reached him, even if it had
then been made public. It seems more probable that Theodore
was here and there indebted to Pelagius. The latter took up
his abode in Palestine soon after the publication of his com-
mentary 3 and from Palestine the book might have been conveyed
to Antioch and Mopsuestia. That Theodore possessed some
acquaintance with Latin is not unlikely, and indeed is suggested
by his commentary on 2 Tim. iv. 13, where he traces the word

μεμβράνας to the Latin original.

ἕζέοξξιέἑ, os Diodore and PelagiuS, it is unquestionable that Theodore

'l'heodore. himself found at least one almost contemporary expositor to
tread closely in his stepS. Long before the appearance of Cramer's
Catenae and Pitra’s szkffcgium, Richard Simon expressed his con-
viction that Theodoret had consulted Theodore as well as Chry-
sostom¹. This is now placed beyond a doubt. The Bishop of
Cyrrhus followed the Bishop of Mopsuestia far more nearly
than the latter followed the Bishop of Tarsus. Abundant ex-
amples have been given in the noteS, and it would be super-
fluous to repeat them here. But two remarks are necessary to
indicate the nature and extentos the imitation. (i) It seldom
is ever amounts to a verbal reproduction. Theodoret recasts
