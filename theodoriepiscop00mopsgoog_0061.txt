or·- THE LATm TRANSLA‘rmN. li

, Thus it appears that only five writers anterior to the thir· Genera!
teenth century are known to have cited Tbeodore under the ἀὼς·
name of Ambrose. Of these the first is of uncertain date, but not
earlier than the beginning of the eighth century3 the second
belongs to the age of Charlemagne and Lewis3 the last three
lived in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Three MSS. might
have supplied these writers with their knowledge of the book3
one Ms. was possibly derived from Spain or seen there by
SeduliuS, a second was probably the property of the Abbey of
Fulda in the time of RabanuS, the third was either brought from

Italy by Lanfranc¹, or, as seems more likely, found by him at
Bec .
