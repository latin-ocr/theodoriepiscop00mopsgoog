e. g. in PhilippianS‚ only vi. vii. viii. appear ; but its character is
sufficiently indicated to shew the system which was familiar to
the writer of the MS. or of its archetype, ppssibly to the translator
of the commentary.

The MS. has been oerefully corrected throughout, by a later
as well as by a contemporary hand, and possibly more than once.
The corrections are partly orthographical, partly attempts to
improve upon the Latinity of the version3 in some few cases the
corrector has hit upon a successful emendation of an undoubtedly
corrupt reading. ’

Muscam, and is briefly described in the Harley Catalogue ⁸. The
present Keeper of the MSS, Mr E. Maunde Thompson‚ has
favoured me with a fuller account which 1 now append—the
result of an examination of the MS. which he kindly offered to
undertake.

“ Harley MS. 3063.

Vellum ς ι92 leaveS, measuring ro} κ 8 inches, with twenty-
eight‚ sometimes twenty-six, lines in a page. Several of the leaves
at the end of the volume have been gnawed round the margins
by mice, but the text of only the last three leaves has suffered
from this cause and from damp.

The MS. now consists of twenty-four, but originally contained
thirty-tvm, quires; eight having been lost from the beginning.
Each quire is made up of eight leave8‚ with the exception of the
fifth, originally thirteenth, quire, which is of six leaves. The
earlier quires have no signatureS, but the rest (ff. 39—192) are
regularly numbered at the foot of the first page of each with
Roman numerals from xnu. to xxxxi. The ruling is drawn on
