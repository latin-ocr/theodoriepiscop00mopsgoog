of that new creation which he has inaugurated, and in the future
world he will be adored by all (Gal. iii. 27, 28 3 Eph. i. ro, 20 3
Phil. ii. 10, 11). The assumption of human flesh by God the
Word is a reality 3 the visible Christ was no phantom3 the “ form
of a servant '' signifies our human nature, as “ the form of God '’
signifies the Nature of God3 the “likeness of man '’ in which
Our Lord was formed was true Man (Phil. ii. 73 1 Tim. iii. 163
2 Tim. ii. 8). But if it be asked in what sense God dwelt in
this Man, we must reply that it was by a special disposition
towards him, a disposition of entire complacency (Eph. i. 22, 2 3 3
iv. 9). God, in His uncircumscribed Nature and Essence, fills
the universe, nay, is all in all 3 in Christ, He dwells in the Person
of the Word by a moral union so unexampled and complete,
that the Divine Word and the Humanity which He assumed
are constantly regarded as being One person (Rom. i. 2——33
work of Phil. ii. 8 3 1 Tim. iii. 16). (vi) The Man who thus became the
C³¹³¹⁵T· habitation of God the Word received at his Baptism the further
indwelling of God the Holy Ghost, by Whose power he wrought
miracleS, attained to moral perfection, and accomplished all that was
necessary for the salvation of mankind (ι Tim. iii. 16). At length
He submitted to death, in such wise however that the indwelling
Godhead was not exposed to the· contact of mortality (Heb. ii.
9 [χωρὶς θεοῦ]). The Man died, both because death is an ac-
cident of humanity (Phil. ii. 8), and also with the Divinely sore·
seen purpose of paying the debt which was due to the Law
on the score of human sin (Gal. iii. 12 ; iv. 4—5), of vanquishing
the Devil and delivering mankind from his grasp (Eph. iv. 8), and
os securing for the race a sinless immortality (Rom. viii. 3 ; Eph. i.
7 3 ii. 13, 163 Col. ii.. 11). He died that He might rise from the
dead, and conquer death (Gal. v. 1 1). Our nature died in Him
and rose again (Rom. vi. 63 Col. ii. 143 iii. 3); He is the first·
fruits of risen humanity, “the firstborn from the dead’' (Eph. i.
63 Col. i. 18). Such is the power of His resurrection that it will
effectuate the resurrection of all mankind (Phil. iii. 10), and thus
reunite creation, rent asunder by human mortality (Col. i. 20 3
The ii. 15). (vii) Christ, Himself united to God, unites believers to
munch, Himself in the community of His Body, the Church. Not only

ξιιιὶἓηζῗῗιῖᾱ by sharing our nature, but by imparting to us His Spirit, He enters
ζξῖαἳιῗίιὲἒδ· into a close relationship with uS, like that of the head to the
members or os the husband to the wife (1 Cor. xi. 3: Gal. iii.

293 Eph. i. 22, 233 ii. 63 iii. 193 iv. 15, 163 v. 23, sq).
