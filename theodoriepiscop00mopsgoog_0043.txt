nocetur for nocitos, necesse habebantur for neceesabantur. A difficult
word is replaced by an easier, e. g'. in dubitationem is written for ³
in aporia (p. 211), temporalia sor corporalia (p. 240). There is
also the usual proportion of mere blunders (e. g. p. 207 peruenit
sor perneni‚· 21 1 nt ducam for nt decat, apparatus for aporiatus ,-
220 dt‘cit for dect, quo diuina for quod in una, nam for non,· 226

profectus for prouectus,· 2 37 immortalia for immortali, 250 mer·
cedes for mercedis.- 2 5 1 numquid for nam quod.

Most of these errors and corrections are doubtless due to

Rabanus or his copyists 3 a few may be chargeable to his editor.
Τ110 MS. from which Rabanus drew seems to have been near os
11111 10 1110 archetype of C and H. It shared their errors3 in
common with them both it gave sezpsis ceteros for seipsos ceteris
(p. 201), contemplationem for contemplatione (p. 205), impietatis
for pietatis (p. 207), laborem for laborum, dispensationem for despe-
rationem (p. 210), uitam for uos (p. 2 1 2), concedebant for condece-
bant (p. 218), dimitam for tndiuiram (p. 220), sorti for j‘ot‘te (2 2 3).
N early forty such coincidences may be found in the commentary
on the Epistle to the Philippians alone. It shared their omis·-
sions3 examples may be seen on pp. 201, 217, 235, ²51· In
one remarkable instance it agreed with our MSS. in inserting
a whole verse of the Epistle at a wrong place 3 500 p. 216, l. 14,
note. This case seems to shew that Rabanus’s copy was an
earlier one than the archetype of C and J13 since a double error
which occurred in the F ulda MS. had been partly corrected in
the MS. from which both C and H were derived.
. Where the Corbie and Harley MSS. are at variance, the
MS. used by Rabanus sided sometimes with the one, sometimes
with the other, but most frequently with C. An earlier copy than
either C or Η, it would seem to have had more affinity to the MS.
from which C was transcribed‚ than to the original of HC Where
it differs from both, it occasionally presents a singular coincidence
with the corrections of C3 see e. g. p. 245, where sor secundum
Rabanus and the Corbie corrector give sed cum.
