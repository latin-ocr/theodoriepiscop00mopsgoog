In five ofgthese specimens Theodore appears to have seized
the idea presented by Diodore, but to have worked it out in a
characteristic manner 3 in (c) he has distinctly set aside his master’s
interpretation ·in favour of one which fits in with his own more
elaborate system of theology. Whether the coincidences are due
to a direct use of Diodore’s commentary or to recollections of his
teaching‚ it is 'impossible to ascertain 5 but their very partial charac-
ter encourages the belief ,that Theodore's work is far from being a ἡ
mere echo of either. ’

The relation which Theodore’s commentary bears to the brief
notes now generally ascribed to Pelagius, is perplexing. There
are passages in the latter where it seems difficult to deny the
influence of Theodore, unless we assume either that Theodore
had seen the work of PelagiuS, or that they drew from a common
source¹. Compare the following extracts :

PELAGmS. THEODORE.
(a) Gal. ii. 2.

‘⁴ ne sorte...hoc non est dubitantis.'’ ‘⁴ nam quod dicitur ne quoquo modo,
non dubitationis causa dicitur.'’

(b) Gal. ii. ro.

“pauperum...quorum bona fuerant “eo quod illos qui Christo crede-
α Iudaeis inuasa, sicut legimus ad He· bant tunc Iudaei...propriis rebus nu·
bracos, '⁹ dare more tyrannorum properabant.’'

¹ Origen, or more probably, Dio· on 2 Tim. ii. 20, where Pel. says:
dore. But see above p. lxxii. On the “magnam domum non ecclesiam
other hand Pelagius and Theodore are dicit, ut quidam putant, quae non
sometimes directly opposed; cf. Th. habet maculam‚'' &c-
