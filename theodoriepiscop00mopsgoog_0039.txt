THE MSS. ΟΝ WHICH THIS EDITION 13 BAsssD. xxix ‚

tolas uenerabilis apostoli Pauli exordium ut fieret praecesserunt,
multae quoque ut perficeretur subsecutae sunt...Sane sententias
appositas illorum auctorum aut certis titulis aut testium relatione
fore cognoui quorum eis nomina praelata sunt3 quas diuerso modo
composui, nunc totum quod congruum uisum est scribendO, nunc
quod nimium erat abbreuiando, nunc quod parum mihi uidebatur
sicut ratio postulabat ampliando. quod simul in uno loco duorum
aut trium dicta consimilia posui, non solum ob firmitatis indicium,

immo potius ob quorundam inuidorum reprehendentium uitium .

eo modo compescendum feci.”

In the body of the compilation 1 have noticed the names
of Origen, Ambrose‚ Jerome, Angustiae, Le0‚ Gregory, Bede‚
Haymo, Lanfranc, Ivo, Anselm, an‘d Lambert (P). The identifi-
cation of the sources becomes less frequent as the work proceeds,
and in the commentary on 2 Tim„ Tit„ Philemon, very few names
occur. “ Ambrosius ” appears to be (1) Ambrosiaster (Rom, 1
and 2 Cor.); (2) Theodore (Gal—Philemon, but not in all cases);
(3) the writer of the commentary on Hebrews printed in the Paris
edition of S. Ambrose (1632).

The extracts from Theodore agree pretty closely with those
which are to be found in the printed Lansranc 3 any important
divergences have been pointed out in the footnotes. Ι have used
the Emmanuel MS„ which was the first that came to my know-
ledge 3 but the copy in the University Library has been subse·
quently compared throughout, without exhibiting however any
noteworthy variants.

ιι.
With the view of testing th} relation in which our two MSS.

Compari-

stand to one another, I have compared the readings of C and H son ⁰s ²¹¹⁶

in the commentary on the first and last of the Epistles contained
in this volume„ My examination of these portions of the text has
led me to the following resultS.

(1) The MSS. agree in presenting a number of errors which
point distinctly to a source not far remote. Both substitute
praeuan‘mtum for praedicatum (p. 33), Christum for Spin’tum (36),
suam for fidem, dominum for quoniam, aestimaret nos for aesti-
maremus (53), agiltk for angelis, confusus for confossus (1 10), laetitia
for laodicia (253), agens for agentes (258), redtens for redigens (271),
mopiam for inspiciunt (276), uobis for uos (279), eruditi for eruti
(287), commemorationem for commorationem (298), uestrae for

Corbie and
Harley
MSS.

lated.
