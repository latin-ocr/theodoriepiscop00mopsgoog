(Gal. vi. 1), ministers to our passions and appetites, and in
manifold ways furnishes facilities for sin (Rom. vii. 14, 17, 18 3
Gal. ii. 15, 16 3 Eph. ii. 10). Thus as death came into the
world by sin, so is sin the consequence of our mortality (Eph. i.
73 iv. 223 et passim) 3 and in this sense Adam’s sin and death
are inherited by the whole race (Rom. v. 13). It is this mortal
state with the constant liability to sin which it entans, which S. Paul
frequently designates the ‘flesh' (Rom. vii. 5, 143 Gal. ii. 203 v.
15)3 not intending by that term to accuse our nature (Rom.
xiii. 14), but indicating its present subjection to the reign of death.
(iv) Since the Fall dissolved the unity of the κόσμος by intro- Manjs res-
ducing death into the nature of man, no remedial system would mmmm
have been complete which fell short of restoring man to a sinless
immortality. Now the Mosaic Law was obviously inadequate
sor this work (Rom. v. 133 Gal. ii. 153 iv. 24), in the face os
our natural weakness and mortality (Rom. viii. 3)3 whilst in
a sinless and deathless state its prohibitions would be uselesS,
and its ritual impossible (Gal. i. 4 3 iii. 13, 14). Its office,
therefore, was simply preparatory and paedagogic3 it detected
and condemned sin 3 it taught virtue 3 it led men to expect a
Deliverer3 it trained the Jewish race to be the first evangelists
of the world (Rom. vii. 7, 193 x. 14, 153 Gal. iii. 23, 243 Eph.
ii. 10). To restore man, to restore in man the harmony of crea-
tion‚ nothing less was necessary than a reconstitution of the
κόσμος 3 a gathering together anew of all things under a new
Head, who must be at once a sinless and immortal man, and
indissolubly united to God (Eph. i. 10 3 Col. i. 16). (v) The Person of
hope of this restoration, inspired by the Law and the Prophet3‚ CHMST·
was in due season (Eph. i. 10) realized by the Advent of Christ.
In Jesus of Nazareth (Heb. i. 9) the invisible Word‚ the Only
Begotten of the Father, manifested Himself, dwelling in the
Man, and inseparably united to him (Col. i. 16 3 1 Tim. iii. 16).
The Man Christ—for in S. Paul’s Epistles the word Christ fre-
quently represents the human nature (Eph. i. 7, 8, 15, 16). although
it may also include the idea of the indwelling Deity (Phil. ii. 8)
——the Man Christ is thus the visible image of the invisible
Godhead (Col. i. 15) 3 and on account of his union with the true
Son of God‚ he possesses the privileges of a unique adoption,
so that to him also the title of Son of God belongs (Gal. iv. 53
Col. i. 13). Moreover, for the same reason, he is “the first-
born of every creature,'' tle. he takes precedence os the whole
