doubtfully, that Felix of Urgel had been influenced by the
writings of the Bishop of Mopsuestia, which in that case
might have reached him from Africa in a Latin form. The

extant remains of Felix are too brief to allow of the theory being “

either supported or disproved. But supposing that Latin transla-
tions of Theodore were at this period circulated in Spain, which
is not improbable, it seems not quite certain that we must look
to Africa as the source from which these translations came. There

 

is the alternative that they were executed·in Spain during the ·

age which preceded the outbreak of Adoptianism. Influences
had long been at work within the Spanish Church which pre-
disposed her to this form of heresy; her weary struggle with
PriscillianistS, Sabellians and Arians‚ her remarkable interest
in dogmatic speculationS, her partial isolation, manifesting it-
self in a certain independence of Christian life and thought,
all contributed to this result¹. Elipandus was able to appeal
to expressions in the national liturgy which appeared to give
countenance to his view². One Spanish Bishop at least seems
to have anticipated the conclusions of the Adoptianists by one
hundred and fifty years³. Theodiscus, the successor os S. Isidore
at Seville‚ was deposed and banished for teaching that “Our
Lord is not One God with the Father and the Holy Spirit but
rather an adopted Son '’—a statement which he probably meant
to apply only to the Human Nature of Christ. According to the
chronicler, this sorerunner of the party of Felix and Elipandus
was a “ Greek by descem, and skilled in a variety of languages ;''
and he is charged with having falsified some posthumous works
of his predecessor, and procured their translation into Arabic in
this altered form. Such a person would not have scrupled to
circulate Theodore's commentar-y under the name of Ambrose⁴ ;

to sorm any certain conclusion with 96‚'874. sq.).
