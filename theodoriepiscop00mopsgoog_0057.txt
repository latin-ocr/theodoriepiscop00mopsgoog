Spia‘legium Romanum and ascribed to ‘⁸ Sedulius ’⁹ -in the MS.
which he employed refers to Charlemagne and Lewis the Pious
in such terms as in the opinion of Mai to assign the com-
position to the year 813¹. Lastly, the editzo pn'nceps' of the
commentary of Sedulius was taken from a MS. which the editor
describes as adorandae uetustati.»- and which he had from the
then Abbat of Fulda. These facts seem to shew that another
Sedulius lived in the early part of the ninth century 3 that he
was very probably, as has been conjectured, one of the Irish
scholars who were attracted to the court of Charles by the fame
of Alcuin 3 and that there is nothing to preclude and something
to encourage the supposition that he is identical with Sedulius
the Commentator. On the other hand, it is certainly possible
that the Commentator may have been the signatary of m). 721³;

and there is a piece of evidence yet to be produced, which, if it

can be trusted, raises this possibility into the region of the pro·
bable.

In Ware’s ffi'story of the Writers of Ireland, edited by Harris
(Dublin, 1764), under the name of the second Sedulius⁴, mention
is made of a MS. then existing in Spain which contained a work
entitled Concordantia Hispaniae atque fflberniae a Sedulio Scoto
genere Hiberniensiet Episcopo Oretenst'. The occasion of this treatise
is said to have been as follows. SeduliuS, who had acquired a
reputation from his expositions of S. Matthew and of S. Paul's
EpistleS, was sent by the Pope [Constantine 1.?] to Spain in
the character of Bishop of Oretum⁸, to settle some differences
