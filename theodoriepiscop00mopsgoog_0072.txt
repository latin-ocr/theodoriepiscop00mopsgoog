these commentaries at least some years after his consecration to the
Episcopate. (b) From internal evidence i‘t is certain that Theo-
dore's commentaries on the Epistles were written after his com-

, mentaries on the Gospels (comm. on Col. i. 173 1 Tim. i. 43 iii.

16). Moreover the manner in which our author cites the Pentateuch
and the Prophets suggests that those portions of the Old Testament
as well as the Psalms had already been made the subject of
critical study (comm. on Gal. iv. 2 5 ; Eph. i. 2²3 iii. 193 vi. 17 3
Col. i. 15, 16; 1 Tim. v. 19) ¹. (c) The cautious balancing of
opinions on the scene at Antioch which finds place in Theodore‘s
commentary on Gal. ii. 11--14 seems certainly to have been
framed in view of the correspondence which had passed between
S. Chrysostom and S. Jerome in the year 404. Again, the frequent
probable references to opinions expressed in the writings of
Chrysostom and Severianus point to a date not earlier than the
first decade of the fifth century ; and if we suppose that Theo-
dore was also acquainted with the commentary of PelagiuS,
our terminus a quo must be pushed on to the year 411 or 412.
Further, there are not wanting signs that Theodore, at the time
of writing, was beginning to excite suspicion, perhaps on account
of his sympathy with the Pelagian party (cf. e.g. infra, p. 208,
l. 6, note) 3 in which case ΑΛ). 415 will be the earliest possible date.
(d) Lastly, the fully developed views of the writer on points
as well of doctrine* as of discipline, and the completeness of the
theological system which his work reveaIS, seem to mark it as the
result of his matured thought.

None of these indications of date, taken by itself‚ can be
urged as conclusive; but their cumulative weight is, I venture
to think, considerable. Until proof is addueed to the contrary
we may safely regard these commentaries as among the latest
os Theodore’s expository workS.

It is probable that the labour of composition was spread over
several years. Whether from tradition or from the Syriac transla-
tion to which he had acceSS, Ebedjesu gathered that the commen-
the carefully constructed arguments lxxxii. 6, 7, lxxxiii. 18, lxxxix. 27,

ancl frequent notes of sequence which xc. 83 Isaiah lxi. ις Dan. x. 13, 213
distinguish these commentarie83 see Hos. i. ι).
