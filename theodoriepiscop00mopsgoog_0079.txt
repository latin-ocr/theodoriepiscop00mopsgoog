the rise of Gnosticism in Apostolic times (r Tim. iii. 16). Nor
is it only to questions os Church history that Theodore pays
attention. He remarks upon points of geography, archaeology,
ritual, literature (GaL iv. 25 3 Phil. iii. 53 r Tim. iii. 13—r 5 3
iv. 7 3 2 Tim. iv. 1o)——all however in stn'ct subordination to his
general purpose os illustrating S. Paul.

system, and its relation to πίστις (Gal. v. 6, 13-—143 Eph. iv. 23
Col. iii. 14, 153 1 Tim. ii. 43 2 Tim. iv. 83 Philem. 2). Much
tact and knowledge of human nature are occasionally ‘shewn in
the application of the Epistles to daily life3 e. g. Phil„ arg.
(“ evenit de primatu,'' δια), Eph. v. 29 (“ non absolute ampliorem
ad viroS,’' &c.), 1 Tim. ii. 10 (“ super hoc necessarium erat,’' &c ),
1 Tim. iii. 2, &c This practical interest leads him osten to refer
to the conditions of the Church in his own day 3 and in the
teaching os the first century he discerns wholesome Iessons for the
clergy and laity of the fifth (ι Tim., arg.‚· Philem., arg). It yields
salutary warnings against the spirit of persecution on the one hand
(Gal. vi. 10), and of latitudinarianism on the other (Phil. i. 18).
S. Paul's allegorical interpretation of a passage of Old Testament
history gives T heodore occasion to attack the erroneous allegorizing
of the school of Origen (Gal. iv. 24). S. Paul's direction that a
“Bishop'' shall be “the husband of one wife '' opens the way to a
long examination of the prevailing opinion as to second marriages
(1 Tim. iii. 2). S. Paul's mode os addressing Philemon is con-
trasted with the arrogance of certain of the higher clergy of the
existing Church 3 his treatment os the relations between master and
slave, with the false liberalism which would destroy the divinely
established order of society (Eph. vi. 93 Col. iv. 1 3 Philem., arga).

Theology in his eyes is paramount3 and is he pays close attention
to grammar and sequence, this is for the sake os the theological
truths which he believes himself thus the better able to elicit. His
longest and most elaborate commentS, if we except the Pastoral
EpistleS‚ are strictly theological (Rom. viii. 193 ix. 143 Gal. i.
3—53 ii. 15, 16, iii. 233 Eph. i. 10, 233 Phil. ii. 8, 9; Col. i.

with the deep and ever present interest which it displays in
