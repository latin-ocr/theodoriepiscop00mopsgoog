equivalent into their component ideas (e. g. α’ντιπαριξιτάζὲινζ
discutere.. auferens ,· ἔναπυτιθέναι, menti imprimere); (c) the fre-
quent reproduction of the Greek almost word for word, even the
order of the words being retained (e. g. 2 Thess, ii. 8—-123 1 Tim.
iii. 2 [⁴⁸ ut autem silentiO,’' &c.].

There are, however, several serious drawbacks to this general lmpersec-
fidelity. Our translator (a) constantly uses periphrases formed 23¹3&
with uideor, possum, &c (e. g. uidetur scn'psisse = ytypuidonxev);1,atinity.

in the same contexts we have commutans...demutatione for ὑπαλ-

·λιίξας. ..τῇ ὑπαλλαγῇ, accipere and suscipere for ἐκλαμβάνειν, legis-
latio and definitio for νομοθεσία-πᾶ (d ) vice versa, employs
one Latin word for two or more distinct terms in the original—-
thus mutabilitas serves for both μεταβολή and ἑναλλαγή, congre·
gatio for φρατρίσ. and σύστημα, forma for σύμβολον and τύπος,
ad plenum for καθόλου and δι’ ὅλου, luxuriose uiuere sor ὥς οὗ
προσῆκεν, ὅπως ποτέ, ἀκολάστως βιῶσαι, contemplatione (though not
in the same passage) for ἀπό, κατά and ἕνεκεν. To these imper-
sections must be added a poverty of Latin words and construc-
tionS, which manifests itself in the wearisome recurrence of such
phrases as locum implere, diligentiam adhibere, in such forms of
sentence as eo quod, ex (pro) quibus followed almost indifferently
by the indicative or conjunctive, and in a limited vocabulary

drawn in great part from the vulgar idiom rather than from clas-
sical Latinity.
