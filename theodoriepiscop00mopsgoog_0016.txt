xii · THE 01<1G1NAL COMMENTARY,

Meanwhile, a large portion of the lost commentar-y on the
sion: ¹¹⁵⁵· Epistles of S. Paul has been recovered in the Latin version which

and i669, are thus described in the
Bibl. apost. Vat. Codic. MSS. catal.

these MSS. is identical, and in both
the work ascribed to Theodore is pre-
ceded by a similar work bearing the

much of the information contained in

stances of the catechetical method of
conveying instruction may be seen in
Cod. Vat. CL under the remaining
tides, and also in one of the Syriae
MSS. preserved in the British Museum
(cf. Dr Wright’s catalogue, p. 985 a.)

In the hope that the above MSS.
might contain something to my pur-

ose, 1 applied sor information to Dr
anazio Gnidi, of Rome; and with his
well-known courtesy he at once con·
sulted the volumes and sent me
extracts from them. The general
character of the treatise ascribed to
'l'heodore may be gathered from the
following specimens ε
