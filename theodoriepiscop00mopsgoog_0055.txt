This remark led me to examine the commentary of Primasius

on Gal.—Philemon with the view of detecting any references to

our author which might be latent there. I foundv many cotn- “
ments of a decidedly Theodorean type 3 but with few exceptions

they proved to have been‘ taken almost verbatim from Pelagius¹.
Examples may be seen in Migne P. L. 68, coll. 587, 590, 593,

596, 599, 601, 604, 606, 627, 630, 653, 665, 668. However, in

coll. 598, 638, 652, 653, 656, 665, there are partial coincidences

with Theodore, where Pelagius has nothing corresponding3 and it

seems not unreasonable to suppose that PrimasiuS, who was one

of the Africans who visited Constantinople in ΑΛ). 550 and signed

in 553 the Constzrutum of Vigilius, had access to the original of
Theodore’s commentary, and even brought a copy back with him

to Adrumetum. But his references to Theodore are in any case
of too general a character to prove his acquaintance with the
Latin translation. In fact, the evidence which they afford looks

rather the other way3 sor had the translation been accessible, why
should not Primasius have cited it directly?

(b) Writing a few years after the middle of the sixth (b) Cas-fif>-

of all the Pauline Epistles ascribed to S. Ambrose, but up
to that time had been unable to get a sight of the book,
though he ⁴was still making diligent enquiry sor it. He had
given orders for certain MSS. of this description to be sent to
Viviers from Africa⁸. May not this have been one of the
