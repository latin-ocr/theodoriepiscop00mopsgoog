perfectly familiar with the Latin versions and largely indebted to to a great
them, is beyond a doubt. It is not uncommon to find two, extent by

three, or more consecutive verses agreeing almost word for word
with the purest text os the Vulgate as represented by the Codex
Amiatinus and the Codex Fuldensis3 ⁹ as, for example, Gal.

Col. i. 1—3; iii. 1—4 A collation of the four Epistles contained
in this volume with the published texts os the above-mentioned
MSS. has yielded some 750 variationS‚ distributed ,in nearly
equal proportion over the surface of the translation. But when
we have deducted these, there remains a residuum of Vulgate
renderings which forms the backbone of the whole work, and
includes most of its lexical clothing. On the average the trans-
lator does not depart from the best MSS. os the revised Vulgate
more than ‚twice in every three verses.

The discoverer of the Latin Theodore, whose belief in the hythe
Hilarian authorship of the commentary compelled him to ascribe
it to a date prior to Am. 368, called attention (Spicileg. Solesm. 1.
pp. xxix, 52) to the existence os ante-Hieronymian renderings in
the text of the Epistles. It is now certain that the translation was
produced subsequently to S. Jerome's edition of the EpistleS,
which is thought to have been issued as early as ΑΛ). 385¹ ; most
probably, it was subsequent'also to 420, the year of S. Jerome's

¹ That Jerome edited the Epistles
as well as the Gospels is inserted from

of his revision, Mill (prolegg. 862) is

doubtless right in· extending to the
Epistles Jerome's own remark as to
his treatment os the Gospels (praef.
