x THE ORIGINAL COMMENTARY,

commentaries¹. There was little inducement for the scribes to
multiply copies of writings condemned by the voice of the Church‚
when the excitement created by the controversy of the “Three
Chapters '’ had once subsided ; whilst it is at least possible that
many of the existing MSS. shared the fate which is said to have
overtaken the works of Theodore’s master Diodore'. Moreover
Theodore’s exposition of S. Paul, even if it escaped the hands
both of Arians and CatholieS, may easily have been eclipsed by
the popular and comparatively unsuspected commentaries of S.
Chrysostom and Theodoret. An occasional copy however lingered
in the libraries of the orthodox East down to the age of the
Greek catenists‚ some of whom ventured to incorporate the more
striking remarks of the great Antiochene Interpreter⁸. It is
scarcely to be hoped that a single MS. of the original still exists.
The writings of Theodore‚ condemned and neglected by the
Church‚ found shelter and an eager acceptance amongst the N es-

eommen- torianS‚ who at an early date translated them into Syriae and other

taries.

Oriental languages⁴. That the commentaries upon S. Paul were
among these translations there are two witnesses to shew ; the
Egyptian priest Abulbarakat [† ΑΛ). 1365]‚ who in a list of eccle-
siastieal writings extant in Arabie in his own day mentions an
exposition by “Theodore the Commentator'' of “certain Epistles of
S. Paul⁵''; and the N estorian metropolitan Ebedjesu [†A.D. 1318]‚
whose catalogue of Syriae books accepted by the Nestorians of
