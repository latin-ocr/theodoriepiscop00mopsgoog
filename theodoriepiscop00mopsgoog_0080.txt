the facts and doctrines of the Christian revelation. Yet if we
characterize the commentar-y as theological, the term must be
used with a double teser-vation. (a) Theodore’s interest in theology
is intellectual rather than spiritual or devotional. Hence his expo·
sition of such passages as Rom. viii. 38, 393 Eph. iii. 14, sq„ is
meagre and disappointing3 and the same is generally true where·
ever the faculty of spiritual perception is more requisite in the
commentator than the power to analyse or to construet. (b) Fur·
ther, Theodore's own mind is so completely under the influence of
the peculiar system of theology which he had been led to elaborate,
that he is constantly reading it between the lines of St Paul's
teaching‚ importing into the latter at times as much as he derives
from it. This is done unconsciously and with the firm persuasion
that he is simply following the Apostle's guidance3'as when for
example in commenting on Eph. iv. 10, he meets S. Paul's state-
ment ὅ καταβὰς αὑτός ἐστιν καὶ ὅ ἀναβάς with a flat negative, on
the ground that the words cannot be taken in their literal sense;
or in expounding Col. i. 13 sq., he convinces himself that the
‘ adoption’ of the Lord’s Manhood is involved in the epithet τῆς
ἀγάπης, that ἐν αὐτῷ points to the second or spiritual creation‚
that the πλήρωμα which dwelt in Christ is the Church, His Body.
There is every reason to think that these expositions are honestly
put forward, and that they were satisfactory to Theodore's own
mind; but they have failed to carry conviction to his successorS,
and the theology which is thus fathered on S. Paul, though not
without a considerable interest of its own as the offspring of an
original and earnest mind, cannot but strike the reader as singu-
larly unpauline. Such a tendency‚ of course, detracts greatly
from the worth of Theodore's commentary as a contribution to the
exegesis of Scriptum, and is a serious set-off against the careful
analysis of language and thought which marks those portions of
the work where his own distinctive theology is not brought into
view.

worse than that of his contemporaries of the Antiochene school¹ 3
in this respect he is on a footing with chrysostom and Theodoret.
