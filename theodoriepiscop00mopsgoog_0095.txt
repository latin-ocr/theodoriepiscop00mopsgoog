As EXHIBITED IN HIS EXPOSITION OF S. PAUL. lxxxv

which is synonymous with our restoration to immortality (Rom.
xi. 153 Eph. i. 3, 13, 14, 22, 23; Phil. iii. 153 Col. i. 285 iii.
14). (ix) This, then, is what S. Paul understands by salvation Predesti-

sin and death? In the intention and will of God it doubtless
is so (Rom. v. 153 Gal. iv. 24); for Christ appeared in the com-
mon nature of all men and died for all alike (1 Tim. ii. 6; iii. 16).
Yet when He returnS, He will come as a Judge, to administer
punishment as well as to distribute rewards (Rom. ii. 173 Eph.
ii. 53 2 Thess. i. 8 3 1 Tim. v. 233 Heb. x. 26) ; and this punish-
ment Scripture calls perdition (Eph. ii. 5), and represents as
not temporat-y, but eternal (2 Thess i. 9). Whence then this
ultimate difference between man and man? Our predestination
must be ascribed to the mercy and grace of God (Eph. i. 4, 5 3
2 Tim. i. 9). Though man has a moral nature which knows
and approves what is good (Rom. ii. 155 Gal. ii. 15—165 Phil.
iv. 8), and a free will to direct his choice (Eph. i. 13—14); yet
his will is disabled by the weakness of a mortal nature from
steadily pursuing virtue (Eph. ii. 10), and needs the guidance
of revelation and the grace of the Spirit (Rom. vii. 193 Gal. ii.
15—163 2 Tim. i. 7 ς Tit. iii. 6—7). The Love of God fore-
knew who would use His grace might, and has elected them to
receive it; of this electiori saith and Baptism are the tokens
and smits (Rom. ix. 103 1 Thess, i. 5 3 2 Tim. ii. 193 Tit. i.
1—4.) But concurrence and cooperation are necessary on the
part of the elect (Phil. ii. 13 3 Col. i. 5), and much is lest to
our, own free choice and effort (Gal. v. 183 2 Tim. ii. 21);
whilst the reward os future glory will in each case bear a direct
proportion to the saith and labours of the recipient (Phil. i. 19 ς
1 Tim. vi. 19).

F ew if any of these lines of dogmatic teaching have been brought How sar
to light by the recovery of Theodore’s commentary on the minor ἑξξῃξὲξῗῗηῐ
EpistleS. The extensive fragments of his expositions of Genesis tary adds
the Gospels and the Epistle to the Romans had already made us ζζὲζξῑέξω
acquainted with his doctrine os the Fall and Restoration of Man, with Theo-
the work of the Holy Spirit, the Church, the Sacraments and the ῗέῐζιθέῗξζὲζ
Christian life. His Christology was well known from the Symbolum trine.
and the treatise on the Incarnati0n3 his teaching as to Predesti-
